<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A PRETTY FACTORY GIRL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pretty Pansy lay lazily in the hammock at the
foot of the lawn, and listened to the south wind
rushing through the tree tops overhead, thinking
to herself, with a blush, that it seemed to be whispering
a name&mdash;whispering it over and over:</p>

<p>“Norman Wylde!”</p>

<p>At the top of the green, sloping lawn stood a
big white farmhouse, with long porches shaded
by rose vines and honeysuckles. Pansy’s uncle
and aunt lived there, and she had come on a
month’s visit to them. The month was slipping
away very fast now, and she must soon return
to her work in Richmond, for Pansy Laurens was
no pampered favorite of fortune, but an employee
of one of the great tobacco factories.</p>

<p>Pansy was only fifteen when her father, a machinist
at the Tredegar Works, had died and left
his wife and five children penniless, save for what<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
they could earn by the labor of their own hands.
Pansy was the eldest, and her mother had to take
her from school that the labor of her little white
hands might help to earn the family support.</p>

<p>Nothing offered but the tobacco factories, and
Pansy went there, while her brother Willie found
work as a cash boy in a dry-goods store on Broad
Street. The three younger ones, being too small
to work, were continued at school, while the
mother took in sewing to help eke out the family
income.</p>

<p>It was hard on them all, most especially on
Pansy, who was so intelligent and refined, and
who hated to leave school and toil at repulsive
tasks among companions who were mostly uncongenial,
for, although some of the girls were
sweet and pretty as herself, others were coarse
and rude, and sneered at her, calling her proud
and ambitious, although they knew at heart that
they were only jealous of the lovely face, so round
and dimpled, with its big purplish-blue eyes,
shaded by such a beautiful fringe of long black
curling lashes.</p>

<p>They all envied her that fair face and those
silky masses of wavy dark hair that made such<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
a becoming frame for the transparent white skin,
with its wild-rose tints and delicate tracery of
blue veins.</p>

<p>But, pretty or ugly, it did not matter, the girl
said to herself sometimes, with bitter discontent,
as she looked at her fair reflection in the mirror.
She was nothing but a factory girl, after all, and
there were people who looked down on her for
that act as if the very sound were the essence of
vulgarity. To have been a shopgirl even, or a
dressmaker, or milliner, would have been far
more genteel, she said to herself.</p>

<p>This was the first time in three years that she
had got away from the factory, and she would
not have done so then if she had not been given
a furlough from work because there was a temporary
dullness in trade.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Robbins had come to Richmond
from his country home on a little business, and,
struck by her pale cheeks and air of languor, invited
her to go home with him. Mother urged
her to accept the invitation, declaring that she
could get along without her, and Pansy went
gladly away on her little summer holiday, which
was now drawing to an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>Her heart was full of this as she swung to
and fro in the hammock beneath the trees, and
listened to the wind rustling the leaves so musically,
seeming to murmur over and over that
name so dear to her heart:</p>

<p>“Norman Wylde!”</p>

<p>He was a summer boarder at her aunt’s, and
he had been kind to her, not cool and supercilious
like the others, who looked down upon her because
she was a working girl.</p>

<p>Pansy thought him the handsomest man she
had ever seen, and she was grateful to him for
the courteous way in which he treated her, never
seeming to realize any difference in the social position
of herself and Miss Ives, the Richmond
belle, who was here with her mother because the
doctors had tabooed any gayety for the elderly
lady this summer on account of a serious heart
trouble.</p>

<p>Juliette Ives was as much in love with the handsome
young gentleman as Pansy herself, and she
sneered at the factory girl in her cheap lawns and
ginghams.</p>

<p>“Actually setting herself up as an equal among
her aunt’s boarders,” she said disdainfully. “I<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
mean to put her down at once, and let her know
that we do not desire her company.”</p>

<p>So she boldly asked Pansy if she could hire
her to do the washing for her mother and herself.</p>

<p>“I am not a servant,” Pansy answered, flushing
angrily.</p>

<p>“You are a factory girl, aren’t you?” disdainfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, but not a servant.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see much difference,” said the rich
girl insolently; and from that moment the two
were open enemies.</p>

<p>Juliette Ives knew in her own heart that her
spiteful actions had been the outcome of jealousy
because Norman Wylde had looked so admiringly
at Pansy when he first met her, and Pansy was
quick enough to understand the truth.</p>

<p>“She is in love with him, and is jealous of
me, in spite of my poverty and my lonely position.
Very well, I’ll pay her back for her scorn,
if I can,” she resolved, with girlish pique.</p>

<p>And as she possessed beauty equal to, if not
greater than, Juliette’s blond charms, and was
fairly well educated and intelligent, she had some<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
advantages, at least, with which to enter the lists
with the aristocratic belle who scorned her so
openly.</p>

<p>And Norman Wylde, who had a noble, chivalrous
nature, could not help taking Pansy’s part
when he saw how the boarders tried to put her
down.</p>

<p>“Poor little thing! It’s a shame, for she is as
sweet and pretty as a wild rose, and they ought
to be friendly with her and help to brighten her
hard lot,” he thought, with indignation.</p>

</div>


<p>The boarders had organized a fishing party,
and everybody had gone, even Mr. Wylde, so it
was very quiet at the farmhouse. Aunt Robbins
and her servants were busy making preserves,
and Uncle Robbins was in the meadow, hauling
and stacking the wheat he had cut a few days before.
Pansy had helped to peel apples for the
preserves until her back ached and her hands
smarted, so at last Aunt Robbins sent her out to
rest.</p>

<p>“I shan’t need you any more to-day, so you
had better go and take a nap in the hammock
before that stuck-up Jule Ives comes to turn you
out of it,” said the good woman.</p>

<p>Pansy went out, but she took off her calico dress
and gingham apron first, and donned her prettiest
dress, an organdie lawn with a white
ground sprigged with blue flowers. A pretty bow
of blue ribbon fastened the white lace at her
throat, and another one tied back the mass of
rippling dark hair from the white temples, leaving<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
just a few bewitching love locks to curl over
the white brow. Thus attired, she looked exquisitely
fair, cool, and charming, and she knew well
that when the boarders returned, tired and hot
from the day’s amusements, they would envy her
sweet, comfortable appearance.</p>

<p>She was not disappointed, for by and by, when
they came trooping through the big white gate
close by her, every one stopped and stared, and
Miss Ives exclaimed, in a loud, sarcastic voice:</p>

<p>“Good gracious, is it Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, of course not, Juliette,” said Chattie
Norwood. “Why, what made you think of
such a funny thing?”</p>

<p>“Why, Pansy Laurens has on her Sunday
dress, that’s all,” with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! Her other one is in the washtub,”
tittered Miss Norwood, and every word came distinctly
to Pansy’s ears. An angry impulse
prompted her to make some scathing reply, but
an innate delicacy restrained her, and she would
not lift her beautiful, drooping lashes from the
book she pretended to be reading, although the
angry color deepened to crimson on her cheeks.</p>

<p>The tittering party passed on toward the house,<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
but, although Pansy did not look up, she was conscious
that one had lingered and stopped. It was
Norman Wylde, and he came up to the hammock,
and said gently:</p>

<p>“Poor little Pansy!”</p>

<p>Her sweet lips quivered, and she looked up,
meeting the tender, sympathetic gaze of his splendid
dark eyes.</p>

<p>“You are a brave little girl,” he continued
warmly. “I was glad that you proved yourself
too much of a lady to reply to their coarse sneers.
Your sweet dignity makes me love you all the
more.”</p>

<p>Pansy gave a little start of surprise and rapture.
Did he indeed love her? The color flamed
up brightly on her delicate cheeks, and the lashes
drooped bashfully over her eyes.</p>

<p>“Look at me, Pansy,” said the young man, in
a tone made up of tender command and fond entreaty.
“You are not surprised. You guessed
that I loved you, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No. I was afraid that&mdash;that you loved Miss
Ives,” she faltered, and a frown darkened his
handsome face.</p>

<p>“Do not speak to me of her,” he said impatiently.<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
“Who could love her after the meanness
and injustice of her conduct to you?” He imprisoned
both her little hands in his, as he continued
ardently: “Pansy, do you love me, my little
darling?”</p>

<p>A bashful glance from the sweet blue eyes answered
his question, and, stooping down, he was
about to press a kiss on her beautiful lips when a
stealthy footstep came up behind them, and an
angry voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Wylde, when you want to flirt
with factory girls you should not choose such a
public place, especially when the girl you are engaged
to is close at hand.”</p>

<p>He started backward as if shot, and Pansy
sprang from the hammock with a shriek:</p>

<p>“It is false!”</p>

<p>Juliette Ives laughed scornfully, and replied:</p>

<p>“Ask him. He will not deny it.”</p>

<p>Pretty Pansy, with a face that had grown white
as a lily, turned to Norman Wylde.</p>

<p>“Is it true? Are you engaged to her?” she demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[15]</span></p>

<p>“That is enough!” interrupted Pansy, with
flashing eyes. She would not let him finish his
sentence, so keen was her resentment at his
trifling, as she deemed it; and, looking scornfully
at him, she said:</p>

<p>“Never presume to speak to me again, sir!”</p>

<p>Then she walked rapidly from the spot, and
Norman Wylde and Juliette Ives stood looking
at each other with angry eyes.</p>

<p>“Are you not ashamed of yourself?” she cried
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Eavesdropper!” he retorted passionately, forgetting
his gentlemanliness in his resentment at
her conduct.</p>

<p>“Traitor!” she retorted defiantly, then burst
out fiercely: “Call me what names you will, I
have borne your trifling until I could bear no
more. If you wanted to flirt, why couldn’t you
have chosen some one in your own station in life,
instead of that miserable tobacco-factory girl?”</p>

<p>He had folded his arms across his chest, and
was listening with a sneer to her angry speech.
When she paused he answered, in a low yet distinct
voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. It was not flirting, but
earnest.”</p>

<p>A sharp remonstrance sprang to her lips, but,
without taking any note of it, he continued
coldly:</p>

<p>“I had a fancy for you once, Juliette, but it
perished when I saw how mean and base you
could be to a less fortunate sister woman. I
have watched you and your clique, Juliette, and
I have been ashamed of you all&mdash;ashamed and
indignant, and my heart turned away from you
to that sweet persecuted girl with a deeper tenderness
than it ever felt before. I made up my
mind to snap the bonds that held me as your slave,
and to win her for my own. But I acted prematurely
in declaring my love for her first. You
drove me to it with your unwomanly conduct of
a little while ago, else I had not been so hasty.”</p>

<p>She stood staring at him with angry incredulity,
wondering if he spoke the truth, if he really
meant to throw her over for the sake of a girl he
had barely known a month.</p>

<p>“What if I refuse to give you your freedom?”
she asked harshly.’</p>

<p>“You would not wish to hold an unwilling captive,”<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
he replied, with a touch of scorn, and she
saw that it would be impossible to hold him without
a sacrifice of her pride. Curbing herself a
little, she asked humbly:</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better take time to think it over,
Norman? I admit I was jealous and a little
hasty.”</p>

<p>He looked disappointed and uneasy. Was she
really going to hold him to that bond of which
he was so weary, against which he chafed so
fiercely?</p>

<p>She caught that look, and comprehended it with
bitter mortification. Anger came to her aid. “Go&mdash;you
are free as air, and I am well rid of a fickle
flirt,” she exclaimed hotly.</p>

<p>“I thank you, Miss Ives,” he replied, in a tone
of relief, and, bowing coldly, he walked away toward
the house, leaving Juliette stamping on the
soft grass in a tempest of fury and disappointment.</p>

<p>He was anxious to find little Pansy and explain
his conduct to her. Surely she would forgive
him when she knew that it was for her sake
he had broken faith with Juliette Ives. Of course
she would be ready to make up with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>And his heart throbbed madly at the thought
that sweet Pansy’s love was all his own. He knew
that there would be a bitter battle with his relatives,
but he was determined to make her his
wife.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A JEALOUS RAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Juliette Ives rushed up to the house presently
and poured the story of her lover’s treachery into
the ears of her mother, who became quite indignant
at the turn affairs were taking.</p>

<p>“I will go at once to the farmer’s wife, and give
her a piece of my mind about her impudent niece,”
she said, and she went immediately to Mrs. Robbins,
who was in the pantry, labeling the nice jars
of preserves she had made that day.</p>

<p>“I have come to complain of your niece, that
bold factory girl, who has been making trouble
between my daughter and the gentleman she’s
engaged to,” she began.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robbins looked around in amazement.</p>

<p>“What has Pansy done, ma’am, to be called
sech names?” she exclaimed, rather resentfully;
and then Mrs. Ives poured out a garbled version
of poor Pansy’s flirtation with Norman Wylde,
making it appear that she was a bold, forward
creature, who had actually forced the gentleman
to pay her attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe she thinks he will marry her and make
her a fine lady, but she’s mistaken,” she sneered.
“It’s only a way he has of flirting, but it means
nothing, as many a poor girl in Richmond and
elsewhere knows to her cost. He’s very wild, but
he promised my daughter, when she accepted him,
that he would reform. I believe he was trying to
do so, but when Pansy Laurens kept throwing
herself in his way he couldn’t resist the temptation
to make a fool of her. So when my daughter
caught him kissing the girl, just now, in the hammock,
she discarded him at once, and he’s so angry
he’ll maybe fall into some mischief that will make
Pansy Laurens rue the day she ever saw him. If
I were you, Mrs. Robbins, I’d send the girl home
to her mother at once,” she advised eagerly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Robbins sat silent, gravely cogitating.
She was a large, fleshy woman, good-natured,
and slow to anger. It did not occur to her to fly
into a passion and resent Mrs. Ives’ harsh opinion
of Pansy.</p>

<p>On the contrary, to her calm, equable nature,
it seemed best to weigh the pros and cons in
the case. Besides, Pansy was her husband’s
niece, not hers, and she had no special fondness<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
for the girl, whom she had never seen till this
summer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ives watched her closely, and, seeing how
quietly she had taken everything, took heart to
continue pouring out her venom.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that girl is going to make you lots
of trouble,” she ventured. “She will want to
hang on to Mr. Wylde, of course.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Robbins turned her large, ruminating eyes
on the lady’s face, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Perhaps he means fair. Rich men have married
poor geerls before now. And Pansy Laurens
is a good-looking geerl&mdash;as pritty as your
Jule, I think, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ives grew quite red in the face with anger,
but she restrained herself, hoping to mold
the simple-minded woman to her will. Shaking
her head vehemently, she replied:</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t know the Wyldes! They are
the proudest people in Richmond, rich and fashionable,
and belong to one of the oldest families
in Virginia. All of them have been professional
men, and they consider working people as no better
than their servants. If Norman Wylde was
fool enough to want to marry a mechanic’s daughter<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
and a working girl, which you may be sure
he isn’t, his folks would disinherit him, and never
speak to him again.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Robbins shook her head and sighed.</p>

<p>“I hate to think of my husband’s niece a-being
in sech a scrape. Ef she’s been bold and forrard,
ma’am, I never noticed it.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. She was too sly,” sneered
Mrs. Ives. “But I see you’re bound to take her
part, Mrs. Robbins, and I’ll say no more, only
this: If disgrace comes on your family through
that audacious piece, remember I warned you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll talk to Mr. Robbins,” was the only answer
from the woman of few words.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE BIRD FLIES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Meanwhile poor Pansy, half crazed with shame
and grief, was sobbing forlornly up in her little
chamber under the eaves.</p>

<p>She believed that Norman Wylde had been
amusing himself with her, and the thought was
agony to her fond, loving heart.</p>

<p>“I loved him so! Oh, I loved him so! And it
was cruel, cruel for him to deceive me,” she
moaned bitterly, while the shame of it all weighed
heavily on her sensitive spirit.</p>

<p>Suddenly the hired girl, a bright mulatto, put
her head into the room, and started at seeing
Pansy lying on the floor in tears.</p>

<p>“Lor’, Miss Pansy, what’s de matter? You
sick?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes. What do you want, Sue?” fretfully.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wylde tole me to tole you to come downsta’rs.
He wants to tell you sumfin.”</p>

<p>Pansy’s blue eyes flashed through their tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>“Tell him I won’t come, that I don’t want to
see him!” she replied spiritedly.</p>

<p>Norman Wylde sighed when he received the
message, and turned away without a word. Going
to his room, he dashed off a hasty letter to
Pansy, explaining everything, and begged her
consent to become his wife. Then he went down,
and, finding Sue alone in the kitchen, gave her the
letter to take to Pansy, liberally rewarding her
for the service.</p>

<p>Just outside Pansy’s door she came upon Juliette
Ives, who said carelessly:</p>

<p>“Give me that letter. I’ll hand it to Pansy.”</p>

<p>She held up her hand, with a silver piece shining
in its palm. Sue snapped at the bait, and
immediately delivered up the precious letter,
which Miss Ives hid in her pocket, then ran away
to her own room.</p>

<p>Her pale-blue eyes sparkled with fury as she
read the tender love letter Norman Wylde had
written to Pansy.</p>

<p>“She shall never be his wife if I can prevent
it!” she vowed bitterly.</p>

<p>The impatient lover waited in vain for a reply
to his letter, for Pansy did not come down that<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
evening, and when he arose, very early the next
morning, he learned, to his dismay, that Farmer
Robbins had taken his niece away on the midnight
train.</p>

<p>He went impatiently to Mrs. Robbins, and she
told him, in her cool, straightforward way, that
Mr. Robbins had taken Pansy away because he
did not approve of her flirting with young men.</p>

<p>“But, my dear madam, my intentions were
strictly honorable. I wished to marry Pansy,”
he expostulated.</p>

<p>“You are engaged to Miss Ives, ain’t you?” she
returned curtly.</p>

<p>“I was, but I am no longer. I broke off with
her that I might ask Pansy Laurens to marry
me.”</p>

<p>He seemed so manly and straightforward that
Mrs. Robbins must have been forced to believe
in his sincerity had not her mind been poisoned
beforehand by the slanders of Mrs. Ives. But
the poison had done its work, and she looked on
him as a liar and a libertine. So she answered
curtly again:</p>

<p>“Rich young men like you, Mr. Wylde, don’t
marry poor working geerls like little Pansy Laurens.<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
I’ve heerd all about your character from
Mrs. Ives, sir, and I know you didn’t mean any
good to Pansy, so her uncle up and took her away
out o’ harm’s reach.”</p>

<p>His black eyes flashed with anger.</p>

<p>“I shall follow her!” he exclaimed hotly, and
rushed out on the lawn, where Mrs. Ives was
leisurely promenading under the trees.</p>

<p>She cowered a little when she saw his handsome
face so pale with anger, and his burning
dark eyes fixed on her with such resentful passion.</p>

<p>Controlling his fierce anger by a strong effort
of will, he advanced toward her, and said, with
forced calmness:</p>

<p>“I am curious to know, Mrs. Ives, what kind of
character you have given me to Mrs. Robbins,
since it had the effect of incensing her so bitterly
against me?”</p>

<p>She tossed up her head defiantly, and replied:</p>

<p>“It was your flirting with her niece that angered
Mrs. Robbins.”</p>

<p>His brow darkened, and he waved his hand,
as if thrusting aside her petty subterfuge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Robbins told me that she had had my
character from you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! What was the foolish creature
thinking of?” cried the lady airily. “She asked
me about you, and I merely said that you were
fickle-minded&mdash;that was all. You will grant that
I had room to say that much, after your treatment
of my daughter?”</p>

<p>He recoiled from the envenomed thrust, and
turned away, with a cold bow. He felt sure that
she had said much more, but she was not a man&mdash;he
could not force her to answer for the slanders
she had uttered against him.</p>

<p>As he left her side, Juliette approached eagerly,
and inquired what Norman had said. Mrs. Ives
repeated it, and added, with a chuckle of triumph:</p>

<p>“He did not believe me, but he dared not say
so.”</p>

<p>“Have you written to the Wyldes, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and colored the whole affair as highly
as possible.”</p>

<p>“You do not believe they will allow him to
marry that upstart girl?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed; for I have given her a fine character,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
you may be sure,” replied the heartless
woman complacently.</p>

<p>“I should die of spite if he married her,” cried
Juliette jealously.</p>

<p>“He will not marry her, my dear, for I am
determined to thwart her, if possible. I have poisoned
the minds of all her relations against him,
and they will be sure to keep him at a distance.
Besides, you said yourself that she was angry
with him, and declared she would never speak to
him again.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but if he had a chance to explain&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“They will have no chance to explain. Their
relations will keep them apart,” interrupted her
mother firmly.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE LOVER REAPPEARS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Arnell &amp; Grey, the firm at whose immense tobacco
factory Pansy Laurens worked, were noted
for their kindness and liberality to their employees.
Every year they planned and carried
out, at their own expense, some pleasant entertainment,
to which every one in the factory was
cordially invited; and this summer it took the
form of a delightful excursion.</p>

<p>A crowded steamer carried the large number
of employees down the James River, and a fine
band furnished music for the gay young people,
who danced all day upon the deck, under the blue
sky and bright sunlight of August. Downstairs
a dinner was waiting, and nothing that could conduce
to the pleasure of the occasion had been forgotten
by Arnell &amp; Grey, who delighted in the
success of their generous undertakings.</p>

<p>Pansy Laurens went, of course&mdash;naughty
Pansy, who had been in disgrace for a month
with her relations, on account of her crime of
stealing a rich girl’s lover away. Yes, it was<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
almost five weeks now since Uncle Robbins had
taken Pansy back to Richmond and told her
mother sternly that he was sorry he had ever
taken her away, since she had made serious trouble
among his boarders, and flirted boldly with
a young man who was engaged to another girl.</p>

<p>He had brought her home to get her out of
harm’s way, he said, and he advised his sister
to keep a sharp lookout upon the willful girl, as
Norman Wylde had vowed he would follow her
to Richmond.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens expressed herself to her brother
as being ashamed of her daughter’s bad conduct,
and determined to keep her in strict bounds hereafter.</p>

<p>She scolded Pansy, and threatened to lock her
in her room on bread and water if she ever spoke
to that dangerous young man again.</p>

<p>Poor Pansy could do nothing but tell her own
side of the story.</p>

<p>She had not been bold and forward. She had
not known Norman Wylde was engaged to anybody,
and she did not know that he was amusing
himself only, when he made love to her in those<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
bright summer days. When she found out that
he was only flirting she had told him never to
speak to her again.</p>

<p>“Stick to that, little gal, and there won’t be
no more trouble,” said Uncle Robbins approvingly.</p>

<p>“Yes; don’t let him come near you again as
long as you live,” added Mrs. Robbins sharply,
and Pansy thought to herself that she never
would.</p>

<p>She was overwhelmed with shame and grief at
this pitiless exposé of her futile love dream, and
down in her little heart was a secret resentment,
too, at the hardness of everybody. Why should
they declare that she had been bold and forward?
She knew that it was untrue, and their blame cut
deep into the sensitive heart. Norman Wylde,
too&mdash;how could he have been so cruel, so unkind?
Her pillow was wet with tears every night
as she strove through long, sleepless hours to
banish from memory the false, sweet smiles and
loving dark eyes that haunted her and made so
hard the bitter task she was essaying.</p>

<p>She was not among the dancers to-day, although
she was the prettiest girl on board, and<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
had many invitations from gallant young men.
But she chose rather to sit leaning pensively over
the handrail and gaze with grave blue eyes into
the foamy depths of the water. Many eyes wandered
to the pretty figure in the snowy-white dress
and wide, daisy-trimmed straw hat; many wondered
why she seemed so sad, but none guessed
that she was thinking that she would like to be
at rest under those softly lapping waves, with
the story of her young life ended here and now.</p>

<p>Ah, how suddenly her despondent mood was
changed! A shadow came between her and the
light&mdash;some one sat down beside her and facing
her. She looked up, startled, and saw&mdash;Norman
Wylde.</p>

<p>Norman Wylde, pale and impassioned-looking,
with a determined light in his splendid dark eyes.</p>

<p>As she made a movement to rise, his strong
hand closed over her weak little white ones, and
forced her back into her seat.</p>

<p>“Sit still,” he whispered hoarsely, desperately.
“I must speak to you, and you shall listen.”</p>

<p>She glanced about her with frightened eyes.
No one was looking. The music was pulsing
sweetly on the air, and the dancers were keeping<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
time with flying feet. She looked up at him, pale
with emotion.</p>

<p>“You can have nothing to say to me that I
wish to hear, Mr. Wylde, for I despise you,” she
answered bitterly.</p>

<p>“That is not true, Pansy, for a month ago you
owned that you loved me, and you have not unlearned
your love so soon. Falsehoods have been
told you, and you knew no better than to believe
them without giving me a chance to defend myself.
I have written to you, but my letters came
back to me unopened. I have dogged your footsteps
on the streets, but you fled from me, and,
as a last resort, I came upon this excursion, determined
to force a hearing from you. Will you
listen to me? Will you let me explain the
meaning of that scene with Juliette Ives that
day?”</p>

<p>She struggled under his detaining hand, anxious
to escape, yet not wishing to make a scene.</p>

<p>“You were engaged to her, yet you made love
to me; that is enough for me to know,” she answered,
turning crimson in her humiliation; but
her indifference and eagerness to get away only
made him more determined to conquer her pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>“Pansy, you are driving me mad,” he cried
imploringly; then, with sudden passion, he added:
“Unless you will sit still and listen to what I have
to say to you, I swear I will drown myself before
your eyes!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A HAPPY EXCURSION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pansy was so startled by the threat of her desperate
lover that she sank back into her seat without
a word, her slight form trembling with terror.
She certainly did not want him to drown himself,
although he had treated her so cruelly.</p>

<p>So she consented to listen to him. There could
be no great harm in that, for it would not alter
her opinion of him at all. He had been false
to Juliette Ives and false to her. She was quite
sure that she despised him, although her heart
was beating furiously as she looked up into the
pale, impassioned face, with its eager, burning
dark eyes, that seemed fairly to devour her white,
startled young face.</p>

<p>Now that he had his chance, he improved it
in eloquent fashion. He explained everything
clearly, making her understand that he was not
the villain they made him out, and that if he were
to blame in any way it was for breaking loose
from the bonds that held him to a girl whose<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
selfishness and cruelty had changed his love to
hate.</p>

<p>“If I ever really loved her, which seems doubtful
to me now,” he said. “It was last winter
that we became engaged, and, although I admired
her fair face and enjoyed her society, I swear to
you, Pansy, that the thought of marrying her
never crossed my mind until one night in the conservatory,
when I was, somehow, drawn into asking
her to marry me. I hardly know how it was,
unless it was the romance of the moment. You
remember the lines:</p>

<p class="center">“Azure eyes, golden hair, scented robes&mdash;
</p>

<p>“They had crazed my hot, foolish brain then.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="displayinline">“Ah, the silliest woman can make<br />
A fool of the wisest of men!”</p>
</div>

<p>“But they say that you are fickle,” murmured
Pansy, speaking for the first time.</p>

<p>“It is not true, my little darling. I never really
fell in love until your sweet face dawned on my
vision. Then I began to realize that my engagement
to Juliette was a terrible mistake, and that
I would be wrong to continue it. But I kept waiting
from day to day, hoping she would see how<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
things were and throw me over herself, as she
did at last, but only after I had bungled matters
by telling you too soon of my love.”</p>

<p>Where was Pansy’s bitter resentment now? It
was melting like snow in the sunshine under his
eager words. Everything looked so different now
in the light of his manly, straightforward explanations.</p>

<p>Her sad heart bounded with renewed hope, and
a leaden weight seemed to be lifted from her
spirits.</p>

<p>“Now, Pansy, you see that I was not to blame,”
said her lover eagerly. “You will forgive me,
will you not, and promise what I was going to
ask you that day&mdash;that you will be my own little
wife?”</p>

<p>She blushed brightly, and could not utter a
word. He took her little hand tenderly in his, and
whispered:</p>

<p>“‘Silence gives consent.’”</p>

<p>Presently she lifted her little head from his
breast, where he had drawn it in reckless defiance
of the whole world, if it had been looking on.
But, fortunately, no one saw or heeded the pair
of happy lovers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[38]</span></p>

<p>“But how can I be your wife?” she whispered,
in a troubled tone. “Mrs. Ives told Aunt Robbins
that your family was very rich and grand&mdash;that
they would never permit you to marry
me.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, I will bring them around,” he
replied, with pretended carelessness.</p>

<p>He would not tell her that he had spoken to
his parents about her, and that both had sternly
forbidden him to think of marrying one so far
beneath him in position, birth, and fortune.</p>

<p>“Remember that you are descended from one
of the first families of Virginia,” exclaimed his
haughty mother.</p>

<p>“I shall only regret that fact if it is to separate
me from the girl I love,” he replied angrily,
and then his father threatened him with disinheritance
if he did not give up Pansy Laurens.
He told Pansy nothing of all this, although it lay
deep in his own heart, like a leaden weight, for
he knew that he could not support a wife if his
father threw him over. He had no fortune of
his own, and, although he had been educated for
the law, he had only just hung out his “shingle,”
as he humorously called it. It was folly, madness,<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
to woo Pansy Laurens in the face of such
prospects, and yet he went straight on, hoping
against hope that something would turn up in
his favor.</p>

<p>“I will bring them around in time,” he repeated,
and she, looking up at her splendid lover in worshipful
adoration, believed him, and bright visions
of happiness flitted before her mind’s eye. She
could not help triumphing in her thoughts over
her insolent rival, Juliette Ives.</p>

<p>Oh, how suddenly the face of all the world was
changed to the girl who such a little while ago
was so unhappy that she wished herself dead!
The beautiful face grew so animated that he was
charmed and delighted. He told her that she
had the fairest face he had ever seen, and that
he would like to be a king, that he might make
her a queen.</p>

<p>All too soon that happy excursion came to an
end, but it stood out brightly forever in Pansy’s
memory. She had been so happy, so blessed; and
when she parted with her lover it was to look
forward to secret meetings&mdash;pleasant walks with
him that would take away the dreariness and loneliness
of her life. He told her that it would not<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
be wrong, and she loved him too well to doubt his
word.</p>

<p>Several weeks afterward Pansy’s mother was
quite sick one day with a headache, and the girl
had to stay home from work. Toward afternoon
she grew much better, and then Pansy, who was
sitting near the bed with her sewing, said timidly:</p>

<p>“Mamma, I am afraid that we have all been
too hard on Norman Wylde. Perhaps he did
love me and mean to marry me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” the mother exclaimed curtly, and
then she saw tears in Pansy’s blue eyes, much to
her dismay, for she thought Pansy had got over
her fancy for Norman Wylde.</p>

<p>“But, mamma&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I do not wish to hear anything about that villain,”
answered the mother sharply, and, although
the girl had made up her mind to confess everything
to her mother, she was frightened out of
it by her harshness; and the next time she saw
Norman she told him that she had made the effort
to tell her mother all, but had failed through
dread of her anger.</p>

<p>They were in the Capitol Square, for it was<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
Sunday afternoon, and Pansy had told her
mother that she was going for a little walk.</p>

<p>Norman Wylde was waiting for her under the
tree in a secluded part of the grounds, and they
sat down together on a rustic bench while Pansy,
half in tears, related her failure with her mother.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, for I have wished so much that I
might be able to visit you at your own home,”
said her lover. Then his face brightened, and
he added:</p>

<p>“But never mind, darling, it does not matter
so much now, for I am going away from Richmond
very soon. Do not look so woebegone,
my little Pansy, for I have good news for you.”</p>

<p>She started and looked up eagerly, wondering
if his parents had relented.</p>

<p>But it was nothing like that.</p>

<p>In a moment he continued:</p>

<p>“Congratulate me, my dearest. I have at last
found a client!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Pansy gladly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and a wealthy one, too,” said the young
man exultantly. “He wishes me to go to London
upon some law business for him, and if my
mission proves successful my reputation will be<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
made at once, and I shall earn a princely fee,
also.”</p>

<p>“But to go away so far&mdash;oh!” cried Pansy, in
unutterable distress.</p>

<p>But her lover laughed.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Not so very far,” he said lightly,
then, pressing her little hand warmly, he whispered:
“We can bear the separation, my darling,
since, in reality, it only brings us nearer together,
as, of course I shall be in a position to
marry then.”</p>

<p>But Pansy had burst into tears. A dark cloud
had settled over her spirits.</p>

<p>No one was near them, and he bent tenderly
over her, trying to soothe her girlish distress.</p>

<p>“It is only for a few months, dearest, and we
will write to each other every week. Then, when
I come back, we will be happy.”</p>

<p>“I feel as if we were parting forever,” she
sighed, but he smiled tenderly, and answered:</p>

<p>“No, no, Pansy&mdash;only for a little while.”</p>

<p>But his own heart was heavy, too. He adored
his lovely little sweetheart, and vague fears assailed
him lest some one should win her away
from him during his enforced absence. She was<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
so young, so untaught, what if she learned to
doubt him? What if the enemies that encompassed
both should turn her heart against him?</p>

<p>A sudden mad resolve came over him. With
quickened breath, he whispered:</p>

<p>“Pansy, in a week I must go and leave you.
What if I married you before I went, and left
my own sweet wife waiting for my return?”</p>

<p>She started and gazed wildly at him.</p>

<p>“They&mdash;they&mdash;would not permit it,” she returned
breathlessly.</p>

<p>He smiled triumphantly.</p>

<p>“We could run away, my pet,” he said. “For
instance, suppose when you started to work to-morrow
morning I should meet you? We could
take the early morning train for Washington,
be married, and return by the time the factory
closes for the day. You could go quietly home
again, and no one need know our sweet secret
until I came back to claim you.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">ACQUIRING A STEPFATHER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Laurens would have been only too glad
to listen to her daughter, if she had had any idea
that Norman Wylde’s intentions toward Pansy
were strictly honorable. But her brother’s representations
had so thoroughly alarmed her that
she deemed it proper to repress the girl with the
utmost sternness, while at the same time her
motherly heart yearned tenderly over her and she
longed for the means of lightening the girl’s hard
lot in life. And it was for her children’s sake
more than aught else that the yet young widow
began to contemplate the idea of a second marriage.</p>

<p>She was still a pretty and attractive woman,
and for a year past she had had an admirer who
had pressed his suit more than once, and would
have been accepted only for the fact that her five
children were, with one accord, vehemently opposed
to having a stepfather.</p>

<p>The widow could not help feeling vexed with
her dictatorial brood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>Her suitor was a groceryman with a fair business,
and owned a neat brick house, well furnished,
from which a wife had been carried out
more than two years ago to her grave.</p>

<p>The widower sadly wanted a housekeeper, and
it seemed to him that pretty little Mrs. Laurens
was the proper one to fill the position.</p>

<p>The children were rather a drawback, it was
true, but he had decided that Pansy could go on
earning her living at the factory and Willie at
the store.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens, all unconscious of her suitor’s
sordid intentions, wished very much to marry
Mr. Finley, and at last permitted him to overrule
her objections and persuade her that her children
had no right to dictate to her in regard to a second
marriage. It seemed quite a coincidence that,
on the very Sunday when Norman Wylde was
persuading pretty Pansy to a secret marriage, her
mother was listening to counsel somewhat similar
from her elderly lover.</p>

<p>And on Monday evening, when Pansy got in,
rather late, flustered and frightened lest her
mother should chide her for her tardiness, she
found the children sitting around, supperless<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
and forlorn, and manifestly relieved at her entrance.</p>

<p>“Where is mamma?” she asked, glancing
around, rather guiltily; and Alice, the eldest of
the three younger children, replied:</p>

<p>“Mamma had on her gray cashmere dress when
we got home from school, and she put on her
bonnet and said she was going out a while, and
that we must be good children till she got back.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I will get you some supper,” their
sister answered, relieved to think that her own
escapade would pass undetected. She bustled
around with glowing cheeks and curiously bright
eyes, until, in a few moments, carriage wheels
were heard pausing in the street before their door,
and the eager children hastened to open it, tumbling
over each other in their gleeful excitement.</p>

<p>What was their surprise to find that it was
their own mother who had come in the carriage.
She was accompanied by Mr. Finley, who came
with her into the house and stood by her side with
a consequential air, while she said, in a half-frightened
voice:</p>

<p>“Now, don’t get mad, children, for it won’t do<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
any good. I was married half an hour ago to
Mr. Finley.”</p>

<p>Sheer surprise sealed every mouth, and, taking
advantage of the momentary pause, she continued:</p>

<p>“I did it this way to escape the fuss I knew
you would all make. I am going with Mr. Finley
on a wedding tour of a week, to visit his relations
in North Carolina. I packed my trunk to-day,
and I depend on you, Pansy, dear, to keep house
for me while I’m gone. You needn’t go to work
any more till I come back. Now, come and kiss
me good-by, my precious children, for the carriage
is waiting to take me to the train.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SECRET VISITS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Poor Mrs. Laurens! Her anticipation of a
brighter future for her children very speedily
dissolved into thin air.</p>

<p>She came back in a week from her wedding
tour, and moved into her new home, Mr. Finley’s
nice brick residence on Church Hill; and then
she hinted broadly to her new-made husband that
she would like to take Pansy from the factory
and Willie from the store, and send both to school
again.</p>

<p>To her grief and dismay, Mr. Finley promptly
refused her requests.</p>

<p>“I married you, not your family, Mrs. Finley,”
he said coarsely.</p>

<p>“But I surely expected&mdash;and you certainly let
me think, sir&mdash;that you would support my children,”
faltered the bride.</p>

<p>“The three younger children, who are yet too
young to work for themselves, I expect to board
and clothe, certainly, but not the two others.
They must remain at work, clothe themselves,<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
and pay a small sum monthly for board,” was
the stern reply, which so angered the astonished
woman that she cried out resentfully:</p>

<p>“If I had known this I would not have married
you!”</p>

<p>“If you married me with mercenary motives
you deserve to be disappointed,” was the cold reply
of her liege lord, and, as may be supposed,
the honeymoon did not proceed very smoothly
after that.</p>

<p>Willie kept on at the store, the children at
school, and Pansy at the factory. She had not
expected anything else, she told her mother, with
some slight bitterness, when she half apologized
to her for the necessity of her keeping on at
work.</p>

<p>She resented with silent jealousy her mother’s
marriage to this stern, hard man, so unlike her
own father, who had been so gentle and loving,
and the breach between her heart and her mother’s
grew wider still as days passed on and
brought the cold, dark days of winter.</p>

<p>For one day one of the little children had unwittingly
let out a secret that Pansy had adjured
her to keep. It was the fact that Norman Wylde<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
had several times visited the house during Mrs.
Finley’s absence on her wedding tour.</p>

<p>There had been a scene between mother and
daughter, harsh reproaches and upbraidings, answered
first by tears, then by girlish resentment.</p>

<p>“I had as much right to deceive you as you had
to run away and marry that horrid man!” the girl
cried, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Finley had so far forgotten love
and dignity as to strike her rebellious daughter&mdash;slapping
both cheeks soundly, and threatening
something of the same kind unless Pansy broke
off with Norman Wylde.</p>

<p>“He is gone to England,” the girl answered
sullenly, and the mother prayed in secret that
he might never return, unwitting of the terrible
interest Pansy had in the absentee.</p>

<p>So the long winter days wore away, and
Pansy’s companions at the factory began to remark
a great change in the young girl. Her
cheeks had grown pale and wan, and her eyes
dim, as if from constant tears. Her light, dancing
step had become heavy and dragging, and she
no longer seemed to care about her personal appearance,
for her dresses were cheap and ill-fitting,<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
and she was always shivering with cold,
although constantly wrapped in a thick shawl.
The gay girls at the factory often teased her
about her chilliness, and told her she must be
going into a consumption.</p>

<p>Poor child! If they had guessed what was
aching at her heart they must have pitied her.
Not a word or line had she received from Norman
Wylde since the day he had sailed away from
Richmond, after the one week of delirious happiness
in which she had been his adored wife.</p>

<p>Faithfully had she kept the secret of her marriage,
but the time was coming when it must be
declared, or she would have to bear the burden
of a bitter shame. Unless Norman Wylde returned
soon, she would be the mother of a child
on whom the world would frown in scorn, while
she, poor girl, would never be able to lift up her
head again.</p>

<p>Oh, how she repented her disobedience to her
mother! If she had listened to her she would
not have come to this terrible pass. Perhaps Norman
was false to her, perhaps that marriage in
Washington had been a fraudulent one. She had
read of such things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[52]</span></p>

<p>“Heaven pity me, how shall I ever confess the
truth to my mother?” she sobbed nightly, as she
lay wide awake in her little room, too wretched
and frightened to sleep, wondering why her husband
did not write to her, and praying always
that Heaven would remove her very soon from
a world that she had found so dark and cruel.</p>

<p>A dark, terrible day came to her at last&mdash;dark,
although the sun was shining in the sky, the
green grass springing, and the gay birds chirping
in the budding trees, for it was May now, and
the world was made new again&mdash;she was discharged
from the factory.</p>

<p>No reason was given, none asked. She understood.</p>

<p>For many days she had seen that her companions
at work shunned and sneered at her. She
had had many friends among them once, but now
not one. She did not blame them. In their place
she would perhaps have acted the same. There
is a wide, wide gulf between womanly purity and
fallen virtue, and they believed that she was a lost
and ruined creature.</p>

<p>As she went slowly, wearily homeward she
felt that she could not bear to tell her mother of<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
her discharge, for then she would have to confess
all the rest.</p>

<p>“I could more easily die than confess to her,
for, oh, she will be so angry, so angry!” she shuddered
weakly, and a desperate resolve came to
her.</p>

<p>She would run away and hide herself from all
who had ever known her.</p>

<p>Perhaps she would die when her trouble came.
She hoped so, for she was weary of her life.</p>

<p>Out of the money that remained from her
wages after paying her board, she had saved a
few dollars. She would take it and go away.
Mamma would not miss her much. She had
never seemed the same to her children since she
married the hard, stern man who kept her at
work even more slavishly than when she was a
widow, for he would not hire a servant, and she
was compelled to do the drudgery of the house
herself.</p>

<p>Pansy went into the house very quietly, then
helped her mother with the supper, as was her
usual custom. She pretended to eat something
herself, then went up to her own little room,<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
eager to make her arrangements for getting
away.</p>

<p>There was not much to do, only to make up a
bundle of such clothing as she would need the
most and could conveniently carry. There were
some tiny garments, too, clumsily fashioned by
the poor girl’s unskillful hands; they must not be
left behind. She tied them all up securely, put
on her hat, and sat down to wait until the house
should be still, when she would slip quietly out
and make her way to the station, where she could
take the first train to Petersburg.</p>

<p>She felt ill and wretched. Her heart was throbbing
to suffocation. How dreadful the suspense
was, how slowly the time crept by!</p>

<p>Thank Heaven, they were all abed at last, and
she could go now.</p>

<p>She rose up with her bundle, shrinking a little
at the thought of being alone in the streets by
night.</p>

<p>At that inauspicious moment Mrs. Finley suddenly
entered the room.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE SECRET DIVULGED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>At the opening of the door, mother and daughter
recoiled from each other with smothered cries
of amazement.</p>

<p>Pansy, who had counted herself so sure of
escaping, saw herself detected in the act of flight,
forced to confession, shamed, disgraced; but after
that one exclamation of alarm she hurriedly determined
to brave it out, if possible; so, clutching
her bundle tightly, she assumed an expression of
calmness that she was very far from feeling.</p>

<p>“Why, Pansy, what does this mean? I expected
to find you abed,” exclaimed her mother,
staring in astonishment at the shrinking girl.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;wanted to go out a few minutes,
mamma, dear. My new calico, you know, I must
take it to that sewing girl on the next square, for
I shall need it next week,” stammered Pansy,
trying to push by her mother; but Mrs. Finley
suddenly put her back against the door, exclaiming
suspiciously:</p>

<p>“Going to the dressmaker’s at this time of<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
night? I don’t believe it! You are up to some
mischief, Pansy Laurens! Running away, perhaps,
and it’s a good thing I caught you in the
nick of time. Give me that bundle and let me
look into it.”</p>

<p>There was a brief, short struggle, then Mrs.
Finley triumphed, and Pansy flung herself, bitterly
weeping, upon the floor, while her mother
rummaged through the telltale bundle.</p>

<p>“Aha, just as I thought! Change of clothes&mdash;oh,
you wicked girl! What is this? Oh-h-h,
heavens! Pa-a-n-sy Lau-rens, what does this
mean?”</p>

<p>She was holding up sundry tiny bits of soft
flannel and linen trimmed with homemade
crochet edging. Pansy did not lift her head. She
knew without looking, and she moaned despairingly:</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, mamma, if only you had let me
go away in peace you need never have known!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“You say that she will live, doctor? Oh, I
am so glad! And yet it would be better, perhaps,
for my poor girl if she had died.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>Pansy’s eyelids felt too tired and heavy to lift
from her eyes, but she seemed to struggle back to
consciousness and hear those words spoken above
her head. In that moment, too, came a confused
memory of the stormy scene with her mother
when she had been forced to tell all her story
and to bear such bitter reproach and shame as
almost maddened her, so that she was glad of
the unconsciousness that stole upon her, blotting
out for a few weeks all the bitter past and shameful
present.</p>

<p>Yes, it had been three weeks since that terrible
night, and when Pansy heard those words
spoken over her head in her mother’s voice she
guessed aright that she had had a dangerous illness.</p>

<p>She opened her blue eyes with an effort, and
saw the doctor standing with her mother by the
bed.</p>

<p>“See&mdash;she is conscious at last. She will begin
to get well very fast now,” he said, and gave her
an encouraging smile; but Pansy had none to give
in return.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that she should never smile
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>When he had gone, she looked wistfully at
her mother, without daring to speak, fearing to
hear again the scathing reproaches with which
she had been assailed that night; but Mrs. Finley
had been softened by her daughter’s illness, and
she spoke to her very kindly:</p>

<p>“My dear, you have been ill three weeks of
fever, but the doctor thinks you are going to get
well now.”</p>

<p>Pansy thought of the words she had overheard:</p>

<p>“It would be better, perhaps, for my poor girl
if she had died.”</p>

<p>She could not speak just yet, but her big,
mournful blue eyes asked a question that Mrs.
Finley quickly understood.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is all over long ago. It happened that
night when I kept you from running away. You
were so ill you never knew.”</p>

<p>She paused, but the big, beseeching blue eyes
were still asking silent questions, and, putting her
hand up to her face, Mrs. Finley said, in a broken
voice:</p>

<p>“Your child only lived one day, Pansy. It
was better so.”</p>

<p>“Dead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>That one wailing cry broke the stillness, then
low and bitter sobs heaved Pansy’s breast. The
mother who had never seen the face of her child
was weeping over its death.</p>

<p>“It was better so, my dear, better so. Had it
lived it could but have added to your disgrace,”
Mrs. Finley kept repeating, and at last the poor
girl, stung by the words, answered petulantly:</p>

<p>“How can you talk of disgrace? I told you
that I was the wife of Norman Wylde.”</p>

<p>“You were deceived, my poor child,” answered
her mother sadly.</p>

<p>“Deceived!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Pansy. I told Mr. Finley everything.
He went to Washington to find out the truth.
My poor girl, that villain deceived you. There
was no license taken out; there was no minister
of the name you told me, and you had no marriage
certificate. By your confidence in a villain against
whom we all warned you, you have ruined yourself
and brought disgrace upon your relations.”</p>

<p>There was a long, long pause of utter consternation,
then the stricken girl moaned pitifully:</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, why did you nurse me back to
life? You should have let me die.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>One week later Pansy was sitting up, a pale
little ghost of the bright, pretty girl who, just a
year ago, had gone home with Uncle Robbins to
find so cruel a fate. She had been watching the
sun set, and turned with heavy, listless eyes when
her mother entered with a slice of toast and some
tea for her supper.</p>

<p>“Mamma, will you tell me why you always lock
my door on the outside? Are you afraid that I
will run away?” she asked sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear, do not be frightened, but&mdash;I am
afraid of your brother.”</p>

<p>“Mamma&mdash;of Willie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is sixteen now, you know&mdash;old enough
to feel keenly the disgrace that has fallen on the
family. He is so angry, and he has been egged
on, I know, by Mr. Finley. I&mdash;I&mdash;hope he will
come to his senses some time,” sighing.</p>

<p>“Mamma, you said you were afraid. You
locked the door whenever you went out. Why?”
panted Pansy, with dilated eyes; and the wretched
mother, leaning over her wretched child, whispered
plaintively:</p>

<p>“Try to forgive him, my poor child, for he is
half crazed now, and his passionate boyish temper<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
all ablaze with anger. Poor lad! The disgrace
has blighted all his future, he says, and he
has sworn revenge.”</p>

<p>“Revenge&mdash;on me?” questioned Pansy faintly.</p>

<p>“Yes, on you. He has got hold of a pistol
somehow, and he is no longer very steady at his
work. I fear he drinks some. He vows he will
shoot you on sight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my Heaven!”</p>

<p>“But do not be frightened, dear. It is nothing
but boyish bluster, I am sure. Only I am
afraid of him just yet, while the drink fires his
blood. So it is better to keep your room a while.”</p>

<p>“Every one knows, then, mamma?” with a
burning blush.</p>

<p>“We could not keep it a secret. Every one
suspected you,” sighed the unhappy woman,
bursting into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>But she wept more bitterly still next morning,
for, in spite of the locked door, Pansy was missing,
and a tiny note on her pillow told the story:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Bless you, my faithful mamma, and help you to forgive
me for my willful ways that caused you so much sorrow.
Tell Willie not to drink any more. I will never come back,
never disgrace him again.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A HEARTSICK FUGITIVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pansy Laurens meant to keep her word when
she wrote to her mother that she would never
come back. She felt that this would be best.</p>

<p>If she remained at home the shadow of her
deep disgrace would be reflected on her family.
If she went away people would forget it in time.</p>

<p>“I should like for them to think that I am dead.
Then mamma would not feel any further anxiety
over my fate. Her mind would be easy. She
would feel that I was at rest,” she thought, and
it was this that led her to take away with her a
small bundle of clothing marked with her name,
and throw it into the river. “It will be found by
some one, and then they will say that I drowned
myself. It will be a great relief to Willie,” she
said to herself, with sorrowful satisfaction, and
with a bravery born of despair, she escaped from
her room by means of a rope plaited of torn
sheets.</p>

<p>Her hands were torn and bleeding when she<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
reached the bottom, but, without a murmur, she
took up the bundle she had thrown down, and
made her way to Libby Hill, that beautiful eminence
overlooking the historic James River. She
sat down there a while to rest in the soft gleam
of the summer moonlight, and to think of the
times when she had met Norman Wylde there
and wandered with him through the beautiful
park, while her young heart thrilled with love,
and hope.</p>

<p>“Alas, alas! he was but amusing himself with
the humble working girl; he but plucked the
flower of my love to trample it under his feet,”
she murmured, in bitterest despair; and presently
she went through the park and past the line of
stately houses that guarded it on the left side,
and dragged herself down the steep declivity to
the river.</p>

<p>How beautiful, how silvery white it gleamed
in the clear moonlight as it pursued its winding
course toward Chesapeake Bay. The factory
girl, whose soul was deeply imbued with a love
of the beautiful, gazed with a sort of solemn rapture
on the magnificent scene outspread before
her, and as she flung her little bundle into the<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
glittering waves, lifted her sad eyes to heaven,
murmuring, in a tone of awe:</p>

<p>“I am tempted to spring into those bright
waves and end all my sorrow.”</p>

<p>Then she saw a dark form moving toward her
at some little distance, and fled away, fearing lest
she should be arrested by a policeman, for it was
nearing midnight, and she knew that it would
seem strange to see a woman alone in the streets,
deserted as they were by almost every one.</p>

<p>She went along slyly and quietly, like a fugitive
fleeing from justice, over the long distance&mdash;two
miles and more&mdash;that intervened between her and
the railway station, at which she meant to take a
train for the West.</p>

<p>How strange it seemed to be stealing along
Main Street like a shadow, frightened at the glare
of the street lamps, lest they should reveal her
hurrying form to some alert policeman. She was
glad when she reached Seventeenth Street
Market, and darted inside of it, gliding nervously
along between the brick stalls as far as they went,
and coming out at last almost at the end of her
journey, for soon Broad Street was gained, and
then, a little later, the depot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>There was a midnight train making up for the
West. She hurried to the ticket office and bought
a ticket for Cincinnati.</p>

<p>“I shall be sure to find work in a great big
city like that,” she thought, as she took her place
in a car and sank wearily into a seat, bursting
into tears as the whistle blew and the train rushed
out of the station, at the thought that she was
leaving behind her forever mother, home, and
native city&mdash;dear old Richmond, on its green,
smiling hills&mdash;the place where she was born, and
where she had spent her eighteen years of life.</p>

<p>She had never known how well she loved Richmond
until she felt herself leaving it forever behind
her, with all the associations so dear to her
heart. Tears blinded her beautiful eyes, and a
sort of passionate hatred for the lover who had
wrought her so much woe swelled her young
heart.</p>

<p>“Oh, did he think of all this when he betrayed
me?” she wondered bitterly, and a yearning for
revenge came to her, a bitter longing to pay him
back in his own coin for all that she was suffering
now.</p>

<p>“Heaven will send me the chance, and I will<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
wring his heart as he has tortured mine,” she
vowed to herself, with eyes that flashed through
her tears, and just then the conductor came along
to take up the tickets.</p>

<p>The car was not crowded, and he had time to
observe how Pansy’s face was all wet with tears,
and how nervously her little hand shook when
she presented her ticket.</p>

<p>“Are you ill, miss?” he asked politely. “Can
I do anything for you?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not ill; there is nothing I wish, thank
you,” she answered; but, as she saw how surprised
he looked, she added: “I was only crying
because I am leaving my native city forever, to
go among strangers. I am an orphan, and must
seek work in the West.”</p>

<p>“I should think you could certainly find work
in Richmond,” he said; but she shook her head
and put her hand to her white throat in such a
pathetic way that he knew she was choked with
tears.</p>

<p>He turned away with a heart full of pity, thinking
of his own pretty daughter at home, and hoping
that she might never come to this. The next<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
day he heard that a beautiful young working girl
of Richmond had drowned herself in the James
River, and his thoughts involuntarily flew to the
one who had left Richmond last night, although
he did not think of connecting the two together,
save as sisters in sorrow.</p>

<p>“There was a tragedy of woe in the beautiful
face of that orphan girl,” he thought often, for
the memory of her grief did not fade from his
mind for some time.</p>

<p>Pansy was touched by his manly sympathy,
but she pretended not to notice it. She did not
want him to find out who she was, or anything
about her, lest it should interfere with the success
of her plan for making everybody believe she was
dead.</p>

<p>But, oh, that long, weary night in which she
was whirled away so rapidly from all that she
had ever known&mdash;it would stay in her memory
forever, with all its pain and sadness.</p>

<p>When they reached Staunton, quite a large
crowd came in, and there was another conductor,
who had so many tickets to take up that he did
not pay much attention to the sad young traveler
who seemed so lonely and friendless, and who at<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
last fell into a deep sleep of exhaustion, and did
not awaken for many hours afterward&mdash;not, in
fact, until a terrible railroad collision near Louisville,
Kentucky, derailed the train and sent many
of the passengers into their last long sleep.</p>

<p>Pansy was rudely awakened by the shock and
jar, and found herself fastened down beneath
some timbers which had, fortunately, formed a
sort of arch over her form, holding her down,
yet still protecting her, so that she was quite unhurt,
although so frightened that she fainted dead
away at hearing the shrieks of the wounded and
dying all around her.</p>

<p>Busy, helpful hands were soon at work, and
within an hour she was released from her uncomfortable
position. They carried her out into
a grassy field, where the survivors of the accident
were sitting around in the burning sunshine.
Pansy was struck by one lady, who looked as if
she were far gone in consumption, and who was
sobbing bitterly over the death of her maid.</p>

<p>“I was quite alone but for her, and we were
traveling to California for my health,” she said.
“Oh, I know not what to do! I am too weak and
ill to travel alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>Pansy went up to the poor invalid, and said
timidly:</p>

<p>“Lady, I am an orphan, and I was going to
Cincinnati to seek for work. Perhaps you would
be willing to take me in the place of your maid
that was killed. I would try very hard to please
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, thank you, my child! I am
only too glad to get some one to go on with me,”
cried the invalid, eagerly accepting the offer.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SHELTERING ARMS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pansy Laurens had found that “friend in need”
who is “a friend, indeed,” when she became acquainted
with Mrs. Beach, the invalid lady. She
took a deep, kindly interest in the lonely, friendless
girl, and during the few days when they
stayed over at Louisville to recover from the
shock of the accident mastered much of her story.</p>

<p>She was surprised when she learned that the
lovely girl was of the working classes, for she
had fancied that Pansy’s wonderful beauty had
descended from aristocratic, high-bred parentage,
but Pansy proudly undeceived her.</p>

<p>“My father was a mechanic, and my grandfather
was a farmer. My mother was a farmer’s
daughter, too, so we were only plain, hard-working
people. I left the public school where I was
educated as soon as my father died, and worked
in a tobacco factory three years.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beach, who was a Southerner, and “a born
aristocrat,” looked honestly surprised, and spoke
out frankly her astonishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>“I thought,” she said, “that the girls employed
in the tobacco factories of the South were of a
very low and ignorant class, indeed. I have received
that impression somehow.”</p>

<p>Pansy thought of Juliette Ives and the scorn
she had displayed toward her, and answered bitterly:</p>

<p>“Many have thought the same, Mrs. Beach;
but in the three years I spent in a tobacco factory
I met many girls as beautiful, as refined, and as
good as are met with in the highest circles of
what is called good society. I cannot believe that
nobility is only to be met with in the ranks of
the rich and well-born. The good and bad are
met with in all classes.”</p>

<p>“That is quite true, my child,” said the lady, to
whom Pansy had not confided the story of her
cruel experience among the aristocrats of her native
city. She gazed admiringly at the flushed
face of the excited girl, and added: “I do not
wish to flatter you, my dear girl, but I will say
frankly that both your mind and person fit you
to adorn the highest society. It would be an injustice
to you to lower you to the position of my
personal attendant; therefore you shall remain<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
with me as my companion, and as soon as we
reach San Diego, my destination, I will try to
secure some elderly woman as my maid.”</p>

<p>Pansy’s tears of gratitude amply thanked the
noble woman for her generous words, and she
sighed to think that she dared not confide to her
the whole story of her life.</p>

<p>But she could not bring herself to repeat to a
stranger, however kindly, the sorrows of her unfortunate
love affair.</p>

<p>“And, then, I dare not, for she would perhaps
spurn me from her presence, deeming me wicked
where I was only unfortunate,” she thought
shrinkingly.</p>

<p>She had told Mrs. Beach that her name was
Pansy Wilcox, and that she had left home because
her mother had married a man who was
unkind to his stepchildren. Mrs. Beach thought
the reason was a fair one, and did not blame the
young girl much. She had some reason for knowing
how unpleasant a girl’s home could be made
under such circumstances.</p>

<p>They safely reached San Diego, one of the
most beautiful and romantic places in California,<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
and for a while Pansy was so enchanted with her
new home and its Italian-like surroundings that
she ceased to grieve for her native Richmond
and the dear ones left behind. A new life opened
before her: one of comparative ease and luxury,
compared to what she had known, for with the
gentle invalid lady her duties as companion were
usually light and pleasant. Mrs. Beach had soon
found a clever maid, and, as she rented a small
furnished cottage near the beautiful bay of San
Diego, and hired two Chinese servants, life began
to flow on very smoothly and fairly to those
who made up her household.</p>

<p>She had told Pansy very little about herself,
save that she was a widow with a fair income
that would cease at her death.</p>

<p>“I have no relatives save a distant one of my
husband, who will, perhaps, be glad when I die,
as he will then inherit the property,” she said,
adding: “But I mean to live as long as I can,
and this charming climate makes me feel almost
as if I am going to get well again.”</p>

<p>“Heaven grant you may,” exclaimed Pansy,
but when she looked at the wan cheeks and sunken
eyes of the hapless lady it seemed to her that Mrs.<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
Beach could not live much longer, even in this
charming climate.</p>

<p>“And when she dies I shall be thrown homeless
upon the world again,” she thought, with a shudder
of fear and terror.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Beach thought of this, too, for
she took a deep interest in her fair young companion.
One day she said gravely to Pansy:</p>

<p>“Do you ever expect to marry, Pansy?”</p>

<p>Pansy grew crimson first, then deadly pale.</p>

<p>“No, never. I hate men!” she exclaimed, with
such energy that Mrs. Beach, a keen student of
human nature, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Ah, then, you have had a lover?”</p>

<p>Pansy saw that she had betrayed herself by
her vehemence, and, hanging her head bashful
she sighed:</p>

<p>“Yes, I had a lover once, and he proved false
to me. No one else shall ever make love to me
again.”</p>

<p>“Poor child!” said the lady compassionately.
She remained silent a few moments, then said:
“I hope you will not think me a meddlesome old
lady, Pansy, but I have been thinking of your<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
future. If I should die, what would become of
you?”</p>

<p>Pansy burst into passionate tears. “I should
never find such a noble friend again,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking of that,” said Mrs.
Beach, laying her thin hand gently on the bowed
head. “Your future has been on my mind for
some time. You ought to be learning something
by which you could support yourself. There are
many avenues of support open to women now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know it, but I have had no chance to
learn anything. Dear, noble friend, if only you
could suggest something!” cried Pansy gratefully.</p>

<p>“I will think over it a few days, and then advise
you,” answered Mrs. Beach gravely.</p>

<p>And at the end of a week she told Pansy that
she believed that typewriting would prove a remunerative
business for a young girl.</p>

<p>“I will purchase a good machine, and you shall
learn,” she said kindly.</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind you are to me! I wish I knew
how to thank you for all your goodness,” cried
the poor girl, with tears of gratitude.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beach smiled and answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>“Only stay with me while I live, Pansy, and I
shall be well rewarded. After all, my kindness
to you is only a species of selfishness, for I wish
to have you with me. It brightens my lonely life
to have the beautiful face of a young girl about
me all the time.”</p>

<p>They stayed in San Diego a year, and every
month made the exquisite place more dear to
them. Pansy worked industriously at her typewriting
machine, and became quite proficient; but
she did not neglect her kind benefactress.</p>

<p>It was both her duty and her pleasure to add
as much of happiness as possible to the life of the
suffering invalid. In doing so she reaped the rich
reward of those who try to lighten the sorrows
of others, for she had less time to think of her
own, and in consequence was far less unhappy.</p>

<p>There was not a day in which she did not thank
Heaven for providing such a safe haven for her
when she had fled, frightened and despairing,
from her old home; not a day in which she did
not pray for the dear ones she had left behind.
Most bitterly she repented the willfulness that had
led to all her sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>“Had I only minded my mother, no harm would
have come to me,” she sighed over and over.</p>

<p>Suddenly over the calm, peaceful life they were
leading in the little cottage home fell a dark
shadow.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beach had been failing for some time,
and at last it became only too evident to Pansy
and the few friends they had made in San Diego
that her days were numbered. The invalid herself
was not ignorant of the fact, for after an
interview with her physician one day she sent
for Pansy and gently broke the sad tidings that
she had, in all probability, but a few weeks to
live.</p>

<p>“Do not grieve, my dear. You know I have
been prepared for this some time,” she said, with
sweet resignation. “It only remains now for me
to make my arrangements for the end.”</p>

<p>Pansy’s irrepressible sobs drowned her voice
for a while, but when the agitated girl had grown
calmer she continued:</p>

<p>“I have telegraphed for my husband’s cousin,
who will inherit the fortune whose income I am
using, to come at once to San Diego; and he will
attend to all the final arrangements. I will be<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
buried here, as my husband was lost at sea many
years ago, and it matters not to me where my
ashes repose, as they can never rest beside his. I
wish, my dear girl, that I had a fortune to leave
you, more especially as the man who will inherit
mine does not need it, being already very wealthy.
But my husband’s wealth, as I never bore him
any children, reverts by his will to his own
family.”</p>

</div>


<p>Colonel Falconer, the man whose coming was
so anxiously expected by Mrs. Beach, arrived in
ten days at San Diego; but the invalid had died
just a few hours before his arrival.</p>

<p>Poor Pansy was once more alone in the world,
for Colonel Falconer, though full of pity and
sympathy for the friendless girl, could not be to
her such a friend as he wished. He was fifty
years old, and a bachelor, therefore if he had
offered to divide with her the fortune that had
come to him by Mrs. Beach’s death the world
would have caviled.</p>

<p>He was a typical Virginian, generous and true-hearted,
and he grieved that such should be the
case, for he would willingly have made ample
provision for the support of the lovely, penniless
girl who had been so dear to his deceased relative.</p>

<p>“It is a deuced shame that my hands are tied
in this way. I feel mean, taking all that money
and seeing that beautiful little creature go out to<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
earn her own living,” he said to himself the day
after the funeral, when Pansy had come to him
to tell him, with a pale, sad little face, that she
had been so fortunate as to be offered a place in
a real-estate office as a typewriter.</p>

<p>“I have accepted the place, and will enter on
my duties to-morrow,” she said simply; and then
he drew forward a chair, and begged her to be
seated.</p>

<p>“It seems very sad that you should be left alone
like this. Have you no relations, no friends, Miss
Wilcox?”</p>

<p>Pansy flushed warmly, then grew pale again,
and, after a moment’s hesitancy, said:</p>

<p>“I came from Louisville to this place with Mrs.
Beach because I wished to work for myself. My
father was dead, my mother had married again,
and my stepfather was not kind to me. I prefer
to remain in California alone, rather than to return
to my own home.”</p>

<p>“She is a plucky little thing,” thought the colonel
admiringly, and he answered, aloud:</p>

<p>“I don’t know but what you’re right, Miss Wilcox,
and I admire your independence. I want
you to promise one thing: You will let me be your<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
friend? I shall remain in San Diego some time
yet, and if you will permit me to call on you sometimes
I shall be very glad.”</p>

<p>He did not mean to lose sight of her if he could
help it, for he had a fancy that if Mrs. Beach
had lived to see him again she would have commended
her protégée to his care.</p>

<p>“Hang it all, if I were twenty years younger
I’d marry her if she would have me,” he said to
himself, when she had gone out, after giving her
consent to his request and telling him where she
should go to board. It was at a very simple, unpretentious
place, for in San Diego, as in all of
the rapidly growing towns of southern California,
board and lodging were very high. It would take
all of her salary to support her even in a simple
fashion.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer knew this well, and his heart
ached for the brave, beautiful girl who had made
a stronger impression on him than any woman he
had ever met. When she bade him good-by that
afternoon and went away with Mrs. Beach’s
maid, who was also rendered homeless by the
death of her mistress, he felt a strangely tender
yearning to take the beautiful girl in his arms and<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
kiss away the tears that he saw trembling on her
long, curling lashes.</p>

<p>He retained the Chinese servants, and stayed
on at the cottage during the summer, and in that
time he managed to see a great deal of beautiful
little Pansy, although he knew that it was unwise,
for he soon found that his ardent admiration
for the lovely girl was deepening into love.</p>

<p>If he had been younger he would have proposed
to marry her; but it seemed to him that
Pansy would only laugh at the idea of having such
an old fellow for a husband.</p>

<p>He did not know how Pansy was touched by
his kindness and friendship. She was very lonely,
for the few acquaintances she had made during
Mrs. Beach’s life did not trouble themselves about
her now that she was poor and friendless. They
were rich, fashionable people, too, who had no
time, if they had had the inclination, to look after
any one not in society. They were very gracious
to Colonel Falconer, but that little typewriter
girl to whom he was so attentive&mdash;that was altogether
different. Some there were who hinted to
him that it was a mistake on his part to show her
so much kindness. It would spoil her for her<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
humbler lot, awaken in her aspirations for higher
things than she could reasonably expect.</p>

<p>They set Colonel Falconer thinking, and the
upshot of it was that he went away to San Francisco
for several months. He did not go to bid
Pansy good-by, but simply sent her a note of farewell,
saying that he would write her sometimes
and requesting the favor of a reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I miss him! It was like having a
kind elder brother,” Pansy sighed to herself, and
now the evenings and Sundays grew very lonely,
indeed.</p>

<p>There were no more pleasant drives Sunday
afternoons, spinning over the sands past the glittering
bay; no more books, nor fruits and flowers.
There was a young clerk in the office where
she worked who would have made love to her if
she would have noticed him, but she never did,
and in her loneliness her thoughts went back
more and more to her lost love and her dead past.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">IN A BOARDING HOUSE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Perhaps it was the brooding over the past and
the pain and remorse that wore upon Pansy until
she fell ill and had that long fever, although some
of the little household declared that it was something
she had read in a Southern paper.</p>

<p>When Colonel Falconer, who had grown uneasy
because his last letter to Pansy was not answered,
came suddenly back to San Diego, he
found that the girl had been ill of a brain fever
for several weeks.</p>

<p>The mistress of the boarding house, who had
been very kind to the sick girl, explained everything
as well as she could:</p>

<p>“She had been looking droopy an’ peaked some
time, an’ her appetite no better than a baby’s,
when she kem inter the parlor one Sunday after
church, an’ set down to read. All at once she
screamed out, an’ fell in a faint. She had this
paper in her hand, an’ I’ll allus believe she read
something in it that was bad news to her. But<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
I’ve read it through an’ through, and I can’t guess
what ’tis. Maybe you kin.”</p>

<p>She put the newspaper in his hand&mdash;one almost
two months old. It was a daily paper, published
at Richmond, Virginia.</p>

<p>“I do not think anything in this could have
affected her. She was from Kentucky. Where
did she get this?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Some transient boarder must have left it, I
think. It had been laying around on the parlor
table several days when she picked it up.”</p>

<p>He went over the paper carefully&mdash;the deaths,
the marriages&mdash;but he saw nothing about any one
by the name of Wilcox. There was a society
column, and he went over that, too, although he
did not expect to find anything relating to her,
for she had been very careful to impress upon
his mind, with a sort of proud humility, that she
belonged to the humble walks of life.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p>“You’ve found it?” exclaimed Mrs. Scruggs.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, nothing relating to her,” he answered
quickly.</p>

<p>The paragraph that had surprised him was
this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[86]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Norman Wylde has returned from his long sojourn
abroad, and his much-talked-of marriage to the beautiful
Miss Ives will take place very soon.</p>
</div>

<p>Major Falconer knew both parties very well,
but he had never spoken of them to Pansy. He
forgot both almost immediately in his anxiety
over the sick girl.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Scruggs, I wonder if I might see her?
I am a very old friend,” he said.</p>

<p>“She is sitting up a little while to-day. I know
she would be glad to see you,” was the answer,
and she immediately conducted him to Pansy’s
room.</p>

<p>The sick girl was so surprised that she uttered
a cry of joy. Her blue eyes lighted with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad!” she exclaimed impulsively.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scruggs went quietly out. He knelt down
by her side and kissed her little hands with the
ardor of a younger lover.</p>

<p>Yes, all his prudent resolves had melted before
his joy at seeing her again, and his pity for her
suffering. Gently, so as not to startle her from
him, he told her of his love, and begged her to
be his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>“I am old enough to be your father, I know;
but my heart is young, and, then, I could take
such good care of you, my darling,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are too good to me, and I&mdash;I could
not love you enough,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“I would teach you to love me,” he answered.
And she had such a deep regard for him that it
seemed to her that it would be very easy to learn
that lesson.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A SECOND MARRIAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>San Diego had a sensation when Colonel Falconer,
the rich Southerner, married the beautiful
young typewriter within a few days after his
return from San Francisco.</p>

<p>He had pleaded for an early marriage, and she,
after some hesitancy, had consented.</p>

<p>“There is no one whose consent I have to ask,
I suppose?” he said; and, after a moment’s silence,
she answered:</p>

<p>“No, there is no one. I have reason to think
that my mother believes me dead. I have no
wish to undeceive her.”</p>

<p>“But does not that seem cruel?” he asked, and
tears started to her eyes as she answered bitterly:</p>

<p>“She has her new husband and other children
to comfort her for my loss.”</p>

<p>He said no more on the subject, and preparations
were made for a speedy marriage. He declared
that that would be best, and Pansy could
not gainsay the assertion. Her small stock of<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
money had been exhausted during her illness, and
she was still too weak to go back to work.</p>

<p>So when her lover declared that they would
be married quietly this week, and go at once upon
a wedding tour abroad, she did not make any objection
to the plan. She was glad to have her
way smoothed out before her by his kindly, generous
hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, how good he is to me&mdash;how noble! I wish
that I could love him more in return for all his
goodness,” she thought, sadly contrasting her
gentle, quiet affection for this good man with
the passionate love she had felt for one less
worthy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps even now he is the husband of
haughty Juliette Ives,” she thought, and grew
cold and pale at the fancy.</p>

<p>She believed that she hated Norman Wylde,
and she trusted that she might never meet him
on earth again. To Colonel Falconer she gave
the utmost respect, and a placid, gentle affection
utterly unlike that ardent passion which she had
outlived and outworn, as she believed, in her
heart.</p>

<p>She thought it a little strange that he never<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
mentioned any of his relatives, and, the day before
they were married, she said:</p>

<p>“Are you sure that none of your grand relatives
will object to your marrying a poor little
typewriter girl?”</p>

<p>To her surprise, he started and looked visibly
embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Ah, I made a clever guess!” she exclaimed,
with faint sarcasm, and then he recovered himself.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;yes,” he stammered, and then added: “I
have no near relatives, Pansy, except a widowed
sister. She has one child&mdash;a beautiful daughter,
who has counted confidently on being my heiress.
I think they both will feel disappointed at hearing
of my marriage, but they have no right to
do so. My sister has a neat little fortune of her
own, and her daughter is soon to marry a rich
man.”</p>

<p>“Then you have not written to ask their consent?”
Pansy asked, with unconscious bitterness,
feeling an unaccountable antagonism to those two
unknown ones.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” Colonel Falconer answered,
with some surprise, and continued: “I’m ashamed<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
to confess that I don’t pretend to keep up any
correspondence with my sister. I have written
her once since I came to San Diego. She has not
answered yet, so I shall not take the trouble to
announce my marriage to her until we are safe
on the other side of the Atlantic. She will be
glad for such bad news to be delayed,” laughing
grimly.</p>

<p>Afterward it seemed strange to her that she
had never thought of asking the names of these
people, who would soon be related to her so closely
by her marriage with Colonel Falconer. And it
seemed equally strange that he did not tell her
without the asking. There was a fate in it, she
told herself, when she came to know, for if she
had heard those two names she would never have
married Colonel Falconer, and run the risk of
again meeting Norman Wylde.</p>

<p>The next day they were married quietly at
church, but there were quite a number of people
present, for the affair had become known through
the gossip of the delighted Mrs. Scruggs. Pansy
remembered with a bitter thrill that ceremony
in Washington, which had made her so blindly
happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>“Poor, deluded fool that I was!” she sighed,
thinking how much sadder and wiser she had
grown since then, for now she was past twenty,
although she looked so fair and girlish no one
would have thought she was more than sixteen.</p>

<p>They left San Diego directly, and went abroad.
They spent a year in travel, and in that time
Pansy learned much and improved much. The
clouds passed from her beautiful face, and she
was tranquilly happy with her husband, save
when one blighting memory intervened. It was
the thought of Norman Wylde and the dark episode
in her life that she had concealed from Colonel
Falconer.</p>

<p>“He believes me pure and good; he has the
greatest confidence in my goodness; yet all the
while I am hiding from him a dark secret which
I dare not disclose. Heaven grant he may never
find out the truth, for it would be so hard for
me to convince him that I was innocent, although
so foully wronged,” she thought often, when the
unfailing kindness of her husband touched her
with ardent admiration for his noble nature and
awakened self-reproach within her sensitive
mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">STARTLING NEWS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Falconer had written, quite six months
before, to his relatives, apprising them of his marriage
to a beautiful young girl in California, but
apparently they did not have any congratulations
to offer him, or they were deeply offended, for no
reply came to his letter.</p>

<p>“I am glad that they can afford to be so independent,”
he thought, with pique and contempt
commingled.</p>

<p>He felt quite sure that they were indignant at
the marriage that deprived his niece of her anticipations
of being his heiress, and he resented the
way in which they had treated him.</p>

<p>“Not even to wish me joy, after all the kindness
they have received from me,” he said bitterly;
and, dismissing them from his thoughts,
he gave all his attention to his lovely young bride,
who was so grateful for his love, and who seemed
to return it in a shy, gentle fashion that was very
pleasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>They had not given a thought to returning
home yet, when one morning he found in his
morning’s mail an American letter, broadly edged
with black. He turned pale as he caught it up,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Juliette’s handwriting! My sister must be
dead!”</p>

<p>And, tearing it open, he ran his eyes hastily
over the black-edged sheet.</p>

<p>Pansy watched him with startled eyes. That
name Juliette had touched an unpleasant chord
in her memory.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer heaved a long sigh, and placed
the letter in her hands.</p>

<p>Pansy, womanlike, read the name at the end
first. It was traced in ornate characters, but it
stung her like a serpent’s fang:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">Your unhappy niece,<br />
<span class="smcap" style="padding-left:10em">Juliette Ives</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>She glanced at the top of the sheet, and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap" style="padding-left:15em">Richmond</span>, Virginia.</p>
</div>

<p>Colonel Falconer had walked to the window of
their pretty breakfast room, and was looking out&mdash;perhaps
to hide a moisture in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>He did not see how pale grew the beautiful face
of his young wife, nor how her jeweled hands
trembled as they held the letter before her eyes.
She read on, with a sinking heart:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Uncle</span>: This is to tell you that mamma died
yesterday, although I do not suppose you will care much,
as you are so happy with the wife who crowded poor
mamma and me out of your heart. She died suddenly,
of heart disease, from which she suffered so long, and I
am left penniless and friendless, for she spent everything
she had before she died. We would have been more saving,
but you always let us think I would have your money,
and I think the news of your marriage hastened her
death, she was so disappointed.</p>

<p>Now what am I to do? I have no money, as you know,
and I am not fitted to work for my living. Has your wife
turned your heart against me, or are you willing to take
mamma’s place and support me in the style I’ve been
used to? I suppose I’ll be married, some time, although
poor girls don’t stand much chance. I don’t think Norman
would care for poverty, though, if only he would
come to his senses in other things. I am here in your
house still. We were glad you left us that when you
married so suddenly and strangely. I’ve promised the
servants you will pay their wages. I hope you will come
home and settle with the people mamma owed. I charged
the funeral expenses to you. I knew you wouldn’t mind.
Please answer at once, and let me know what to expect
from you.</p>

<p class="ir2"><span style="padding-right:4em">Your unhappy niece,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Juliette Ives</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>“So she is my husband’s niece? What a fatality!”
Pansy murmured to herself, fighting hard
against the weakness and faintness stealing over
her. “And Norman Wylde has not married her
yet,” her thoughts ran on, with a sort of bitter
triumph.</p>

<p>She sat silent, crushing the black-bordered
sheet in her hands, her heart beating slowly and
heavily in her breast, a chill presentiment of evil
stealing over her mind.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that I shall have to come in contact
again with that proud, cruel girl? Oh, if I
had only known this I should never have married
Colonel Falconer,” she thought bitterly.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer turned around suddenly from
the window.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, what do you think of my
niece’s letter?” he asked.</p>

<p>Pansy’s face flamed and her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>“I think it is impertinent, selfish, and heartless,”
she answered spiritedly.</p>

<p>He sighed, for that was his own impression of
the letter, although he hated to acknowledge it,
even to himself. What hurt him most was her
half-contemptuous allusions to his wife, and the<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
fact that she had disdained to send a single kindly
message to the woman who was, by marriage, at
least, her near relative.</p>

<p>“Juliette is a spoiled child. She has been pampered
and indulged until she considers no one
but herself,” he said uneasily.</p>

<p>“That is easy to be seen,” she answered, with
a touch of scorn.</p>

<p>“But there is some excuse for her just now,”
continued the colonel, who could not overcome
at once the habit of long years of affection. “We
must consider the petulance of affliction, so natural
in one reared selfishly and luxuriously, as
Juliette has been. Then, too, the poor girl has
had a love trouble that has helped to sour her
temper.”</p>

<p>“A love trouble?” Pansy questioned, in a thick
voice, without looking up.</p>

<p>“Yes; she was engaged several years ago to
a Mr. Wylde, of Richmond&mdash;a fine young man
in every respect, handsome, rich, and of fine family.
Juliette adored him, and was very jealous,
so that when he engaged in a flirtation with a designing
little beauty of the lower classes Juliette
would take no excuses, but dismissed him in bitter<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
anger. He went abroad, leaving her to repent
her harshness, and to try to mourn her haste;
for love soon conquered pride, and she would give
the world now to win him back. I had reason, a
year ago, to believe that they had made up their
quarrel and would soon be married, but I was
mistaken, and Juliette no doubt is still pining for
her lost lover.”</p>

<p>Pansy made no comment, for her husband’s
words still rang in her ears:</p>

<p>“‘A designing little beauty of the lower
classes.’ Oh, what if he knew! what if he knew!”
she thought, in terror that held her lips dumb.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer took up a package of newspapers,
and drew out one&mdash;the Richmond <cite>Dispatch</cite>.</p>

<p>“Ah, this, too, is from Juliette. No doubt it
contains the notice of her mother’s death,” he
said.</p>

<p>His surmise was correct. It recorded the death
of Mrs. Ives, at the age of fifty-four, for she
had been his elder by several years.</p>

<p>He placed the paper, as he had done the letter,
before Pansy’s eyes; and she read and reread the
words announcing her enemy’s death, but in a<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
dull, mechanical way, without any triumph in the
fact that those cruel lips would never utter any
falsehoods against her again. She felt half dazed
by the suddenness with which the past had risen
before her just as she began to hope and believe
that it was buried forever.</p>

<p>Her dull eyes traveled soberly up and down the
short list of married and dead, and suddenly a
wild gleam came into them. A familiar name
had caught her attention. She read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the 6th instant, at the residence of her mother, on
Church Hill, Rosa Laurens, aged nine years and seven
days, of diphtheria. Funeral private.</p>
</div>

<p>It was Pansy’s youngest sister&mdash;the baby, as
she was always called in the family. A wave of
passionate grief overflowed Pansy’s heart and
forced a cry of despair from her white lips. Then
she slipped from her chair and lay in a long swoon
upon the floor.</p>

<p>When reason returned she was lying upon her
bed, with her maid chafing her cold hands anxiously,
and her husband bending over her with
frightened eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Pansy, what a shock you have given me!”
he exclaimed; and as everything rushed quickly<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
over her she realized that she must hide her
troubles under a mask of smiles.</p>

<p>With a pitiful attempt at gayety, she faltered:</p>

<p>“You must learn not to be frightened at a
woman’s fainting. It means nothing but temporary
weakness.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?” he asked. “Because&mdash;&mdash;”
Then he paused.</p>

<p>“What?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“I feared you had read something in that paper
that grieved or frightened you,” he answered,
remembering at the same time that when she had
that illness in California Mrs. Scruggs had asserted
that something she had read in a paper was
the primary cause.</p>

<p>But Pansy denied that anything in the paper
had affected her in the least.</p>

<p>“How could it be so, when I had never been
in Richmond, and knew no one there?” she said.
“Besides, I had but just taken the paper and had
read nothing but your sister’s death, when suddenly
I felt my strength leaving me, and I fell.
Tell him, Phebe,” she said, looking at her maid,
“that it is a very common occurrence for ladies
to faint.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>Phebe asserted that all fashionable ladies were
given to fainting, and his own experience bore
him out in the fact. The only difference was
that he had never regarded Pansy in the light
of a society lady. She was a beautiful, natural
child of nature, he had been proud to think.</p>

<p>She insisted on getting up to dress and to drive
in the park.</p>

<p>“I want fresh air,” she said; and, looking at
her pale cheeks and heavy eyes, he thought so,
too.</p>

<p>“Mind you don’t give me another such scare
shortly,” he said, as he went out to order the
carriage, for they had taken a pretty house in
Park Lane for the season, and surrounded themselves
with luxuries. They had been going into
society some little, but neither cared much for
it. He had seen enough of it to be blasé, and
she was timid.</p>

<p>When they were driving along he said abruptly:</p>

<p>“I suppose we must make some plans for my
poor niece. What do you say, darling? Shall
we go home and take care of Juliette?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[102]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, must we go home? I am so happy here!”
she cried.</p>

<p>“But I shall be obliged to go back and settle
up my sister’s affairs, Pansy.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you leave me, and come back when
you had fixed everything?” she inquired vaguely.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;Juliette?” he objected.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you give her some money, and leave
her there with&mdash;with some of her friends?”</p>

<p>He looked in surprise at the girl who was usually
so sweet and gentle. Her words sounded
heartless.</p>

<p>“How strangely you talk&mdash;as if you had taken
a dislike to that poor orphan girl whom you have
never even seen,” he said severely.</p>

<p>“Oh, forgive me!” she cried, frightened at his
displeasure. Nestling closer to his side, she murmured:
“It is naughty of me, I know, but I can’t
help feeling jealous of that girl you like so much.
She will come between us. We will never be as
happy again as we were in this past year.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he answered; but he was secretly
pleased at her jealousy, although there was really
no cause for it, as he hastened to assure her. “I
am only thinking of what people will say,” he<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
explained. “I am sure we should be happier without
her, spoiled little beauty that she is. But she
has no relative but me, and if I desert her people
will say that it is all your fault. Do you realize
this, my pet?”</p>

<p>Yes, she began to realize it with a sort of wonder.
The fate of Juliette Ives, her bitter enemy,
lay in her hands to make or mar. She knew that
she could mold her noble husband to her will if
she chose; could make Juliette Ives’ life infinitely
bitter and hard. For a moment she was pleased
with the thought, half tempted to use her power.</p>

<p>Then her better nature triumphed. She flung
revenge to the winds.</p>

<p>“I cannot do it. I cannot be so mean,” she
thought, with keen self-scorn. “Poor soul! Why
should I blame her? We both suffered through
his falsity, and now I will be her friend if she
will let me.”</p>

<p>With all that she knew of Juliette, she did not
fully comprehend the girl’s ignoble soul. She
pitied her, and, out of a generous impulse, resolved
to stand her friend.</p>

<p>“I will go back with you, Colonel Falconer,
and I will try to be a true friend to your orphan<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
niece,” she said, believing that as his wife she
could fairly run the risk of a return to her old
home.</p>

<p>“I look older now. No one will recognize me,”
she decided confidently.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE SAD RETURN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In due course of time Juliette Ives received a
kind letter from her absent uncle, stating that he
would return with his wife to Richmond within
the month.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You may rest assured, my dear girl, that I intend to
act fairly by you,” he wrote. “Of course I cannot leave
you my fortune, as I expected to do if I died single; but
you shall receive a fair portion of it, so you need not consider
yourself penniless. I will also pay your mother’s
debts. For the rest, your home will be with us. My
charming wife, who is even younger than yourself, will
be your warmest friend if you show any disposition toward
friendship. I inferred from your letter&mdash;in which
you neglected to send Mrs. Falconer a single kind message&mdash;that
you seriously resented my marriage. Of course
you understand that my young wife is to be treated with
all respect and consideration. While you have a strong
claim on my love and kindness, she has a stronger one,
which you must never for an instant forget. But I need
hardly caution you on these points, as your own good
sense will sufficiently instruct you. Besides, I expect that
you will at once fall in love with Pansy’s sweet disposition
and lovely face.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Pansy&mdash;Pansy!” Miss Ives muttered sharply,
as she flung the obnoxious letter on the floor. “So<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
that is her name! Strange that, as that name
once came between me and love, it should now
come between me and fortune. Why, if I had
not hated her already, I should loathe her for
that name!”</p>

<p>She was alone in the spacious and elegant parlor
of Colonel Falconer’s elegant residence on
Franklin Street. She wore deep, lusterless black
that set off her delicate blond beauty to great
advantage, and she moved with the air of some
princess, so proud was her step, so haughty the
curve of her white throat.</p>

<p>“It is going to be war to the knife between us&mdash;I
foresee that,” she muttered hoarsely. “I
mean to make her life as disagreeable as I can,
out of revenge for the evil she has wrought for
me. Yes, she shall not sleep upon a bed of roses
in this house! I shall be as disrespectful as I
please. They dare not turn me out of the house
for fear of people talking, as I am his own
niece.”</p>

<p>A few days later she received a telegram from
New York, stating that Colonel Falconer and
wife had arrived in that city, would remain there
a week, and then come on to Richmond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>Pansy had persuaded her husband to remain
in New York and show her the sights of the great
city. At heart she cared little for it, but it served
as a pretext to delay for a little her return to her
old home, and to the memories that would crowd
upon her there.</p>

<p>But at last the time was over, and no further
pretext could delay her going. Pale and heartsick,
she was standing on the steamer’s deck beside
her husband while they rounded the last
curve of James River, that brought picturesque
Libby Hill into full view, with all its bittersweet
memories.</p>

<p>It was three years and a half since she had
crouched on yonder hill, a forlorn little figure
with wet eyes and a pale, pale face, watching the
steamer bearing away her young husband on that
mission which he said was to make him rich
enough to claim the bride he had wedded in secret.
How it all rushed over her again as she
stood there by the side of her proud, rich husband,
and listened mechanically as he pointed
out with pride and enthusiasm the beauties of
the river and the land.</p>

<p>“How glad I am to be in Virginia again!” he<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
exclaimed; but Pansy’s smile was sadder than
tears.</p>

<p>Juliette had sent the family carriage, with its
high-stepping bay horses, to meet them, and soon
they were borne swiftly toward their home; but
while Colonel Falconer’s thoughts went toward
Franklin Street and its aristocratic environments,
his fair young bride was thinking of the humble
house on Church Hill, where her mother was
mourning the loss of her youngest born&mdash;the
household pet.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, mother, mother, if only I dared
go to you in your sorrow!” was the cry of her
heart.</p>

<p>But she knew that she must remain dead to
that beloved mother. There was her husband and
her position to be considered, and there was Willie,
who had sworn in his wrath to kill the sister
who had brought disgrace on a respectable family.
Her own safety, if nothing else, demanded
silence.</p>

<p>“Here we are, my darling, at home!” exclaimed
Colonel Falconer’s voice, seeming to come from
far away, so intently had she been brooding over
her sorrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>She glanced out, and saw the sunset gleams
lighting up, like jewels, the windows of an old-fashioned
red brick mansion, set in a pretty green
lawn studded with shrubbery and flowers. He
looked up at the broad porch, guarded by two
lions, and said, in a tone of disappointment:</p>

<p>“Juliette is too dignified to come out on the
porch to welcome us home. She will be waiting
in the hall.”</p>

<p>He led his lovely bride up the steps, and, with
a strong effort of will, Pansy threw off her agitation
and braced herself to meet Juliette Ives
with pride and dignity equal to her own.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A DRAMATIC MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Yes, Juliette was waiting in the hall.</p>

<p>The day was warm, and she wore a black dress,
rich in quality, but of a soft, diaphanous material,
through which her neck and arms gleamed
snowy white. Her golden hair was arranged so
as to make the very most of its beauty. She
wished to overawe her uncle’s wife, if possible,
with her dignity and beauty.</p>

<p>The door opened, and as soon as Colonel Falconer
appeared she rushed to his arms with theatrical
effect. He returned her kiss, and disengaged
himself as soon as possible from her embrace,
that he might present her to the beautiful
creature waiting in the background:</p>

<p>“My wife, Juliette.”</p>

<p>Juliette looked, and saw a figure of medium
height, but so exquisitely slender, though rounded,
that it looked taller. It was clothed in a Parisian
suit of dove gray, and from under the demure
little bonnet looked the loveliest face in the world&mdash;sweet
yet spirited, with exquisite features, dazzling<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
complexion, and eyes of purplish blue under
lovely curling lashes, dark as night.</p>

<p>But what was it that made Juliette stare in
wonder and gasp in fear? She caught her uncle’s
arm, and he felt her trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>“Juliette, my poor girl, this meeting has unnerved
you,” he exclaimed pityingly, and Pansy
advanced, as if to offer assistance, but was instantly
repulsed, Juliette flinging out a frantic
arm to keep her off.</p>

<p>“Keep back, keep back! Do not come near me
with that face!” she hissed angrily; and Pansy
looked at her husband in cold amazement.</p>

<p>“Has Miss Ives gone suddenly mad?” she demanded
haughtily, and at the sound of her voice,
so cold yet silvery sweet, Juliette shrank closer to
her uncle, crying out:</p>

<p>“I am not mad, uncle, but I shall be soon if
you do not take away that ghost! Oh, that face,
that voice! They have been drowned almost
three years, and now they rise to haunt me from
their watery grave!”</p>

<p>She began to scream with actual terror, bringing
the housekeeper and several servants to the
scene. Her uncle caught her in his arms and<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
carried her into the parlor, saying to Pansy over
his shoulder:</p>

<p>“Keep out of sight a few moments, dear, and
I will bring her to her senses. She has evidently
been startled by your likeness to some one she
has known.”</p>

<p>Pansy sat down just inside the parlor door,
which she carefully closed, thus shutting out the
gaping servants. Colonel Falconer set himself
to the task of quieting his hysterical niece.</p>

<p>Believing herself alone with him, she soon grew
calmer, and asked:</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, where did you find that girl? I
thought she was dead!”</p>

<p>“Of whom does she remind you, dear?” he
asked soothingly.</p>

<p>Shivering with terror, she replied:</p>

<p>“Of Pansy Laurens, the girl who made all the
trouble between Norman and myself. You know,
it was thought she drowned herself, but now I
can no longer believe it, for surely this is no other
than Pansy Laurens!”</p>

<p>Pansy sat motionless, and heard her husband
saying sternly:</p>

<p>“You will oblige me, Juliette, by never making<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
such foolish remarks again. I never saw
Pansy Laurens; but if my wife resembles her,
that is nothing but a chance likeness. Mrs. Falconer
was a Miss Wilcox, of Louisville, and has
never been in Richmond until to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, are you sure? For indeed she
frightened me with her awful likeness, although
I believe she is prettier than that Laurens creature,”
gasped Juliette.</p>

<p>“Prettier&mdash;well, I should say so! My wife
is the loveliest creature on earth!” exclaimed the
jovial colonel.</p>

<p>But Juliette, still shivering, sighed:</p>

<p>“How can I live in the same house with that
face and voice?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A FALSE SMILE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Falconer began to grow angry at Juliette’s
foolishness, as he called it to himself.
Drawing back from her, he said stiffly:</p>

<p>“If you cannot live in the same house with my
wife, Juliette, you are quite at liberty to seek a
boarding house anywhere you choose, and I will
pay your board and furnish you pin money.”</p>

<p>Juliette sprang upright in a perfect fury,
shrieking out:</p>

<p>“You are planning to get rid of me already!”</p>

<p>Before the poor, badgered man could reply,
Pansy came gliding forward, and said sweetly:</p>

<p>“Perhaps Miss Ives would prefer for us to go
away, and leave her in possession of the house.
If so, I am perfectly willing to do so, as I fear
we shall not get on together, judging from what
I have already seen of her disposition toward
me.”</p>

<p>She hoped that Juliette would take her at her
word, and that by this means she would be enabled
to leave this once dear, now dreaded, city.<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
She was frightened, too, at Juliette’s recognition
of her, and foresaw trouble if she remained.</p>

<p>But Juliette was startled at her uncle’s proposition,
and she began to come to her senses. She
remembered that but for his liberality she must be
a beggar, and she dared not try him too far.
Summoning a false, sweet smile to her lips, she
turned to him, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Dear uncle, forgive me. I fear I have been
acting very foolishly. Of course, I do not want
to go away from the only relative I have in the
world, now that poor mamma is dead. I love you
too well to leave you, or to drive you from me.
And, indeed, I was preparing to welcome my new
aunt with affection, when her striking likeness so
startled me that I behaved ridiculously, I fear,
on the impulse of the moment. You will excuse
me, Mrs. Falconer, will you not?” turning to
Pansy and holding out a hand sparkling with
costly gems.</p>

<p>Pansy clasped the offered hand with one as
cold as ice, even through its tiny gray kid glove, as
she replied:</p>

<p>“Certainly, Miss Ives, for I am anxious to be
your friend, if you will let me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, thank you! I shall only be too glad,
for I had feared that a beautiful young wife
would prejudice my uncle against me, and I am
glad to find that it is not so,” exclaimed Juliette,
with pretended cordiality. Rising to her feet,
she continued: “Excuse me one moment, while I
see if your rooms are in readiness.”</p>

<p>She ran hastily to her own apartment, where
she secured a framed photograph of Norman
Wylde, which she placed conspicuously on the
mantel of Pansy’s room.</p>

<p>“I believe she is Pansy Laurens, and I shall
prepare many a severe test for her,” she muttered
angrily, as she returned to the parlor and
told Pansy, with a show of friendliness, that her
rooms were in readiness, and she was ready to
show them to her.</p>

<p>They walked side by side through the broad
hall, with its Turkish carpet, statuary in niches,
and stands of blooming flowers, up the broad
stairway to a suite of beautiful rooms in cream
and scarlet.</p>

<p>“I hope you will like these rooms. Mamma
had them furnished over but a few months ago.
Mine are like these, only in blue,” said Juliette,<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
with a patronizing air that at once aroused a
teasing mood in Pansy, and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Then I ought to have had your rooms instead
of these, for blue is my color, too!”</p>

<p>She saw a frown contract Juliette’s eyebrows,
but she took no notice, and walked over to the
mantel, where the first thing she saw was the
handsome face of Norman Wylde smiling on her
from an easel frame. It gave her a start, but
she had nerved herself to meet even the original
in this house, and now she merely lifted her arm
to take up a piece of bric-a-brac and examine it
more closely, when the hanging sleeve of her light
gray wrap caught the top of the small easel, and
it was instantly hurled to the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, what have I broken?” she cried, in pretended
dismay. And Juliette came forward to
gather up the fragments.</p>

<p>“The easel is broken, but the photograph is
unhurt. See,” she said, holding it up before
Pansy’s eyes and watching her closely; but Pansy
glanced at it with the careless interest of a
stranger.</p>

<p>“What a handsome young man!” she said. “Is
he one of your admirers, Miss Ives?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>“I was once engaged to him,” Juliette answered.
“I will take it away,” she added, hurrying
out of the room to conceal her chagrin at
the failure of her first test.</p>

<p>She could not decide whether the accident had
been a real one or not. Pansy had carried it out
with such perfect ease that she began to falter in
her belief that this was Pansy Laurens.</p>

<p>“I may possibly be mistaken, but the likeness
is so startling that I shall test her in every way,”
she decided.</p>

<p>The next morning Pansy appeared at their late
breakfast in such an exquisite and becoming
morning gown that Juliette could not repress her
admiration, in spite of the anger with which she
saw her uncle’s wife take her place in front of
the coffee urn.</p>

<p>“I thought you would be too tired to pour coffee
this first morning,” she said, almost angrily.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, indeed. I feel quite well, thank you,”
was the bright reply, and, as her white hands
fluttered like birds over the china and silver, she
continued: “Colonel Falconer, I hope you are
going to take me for a long drive to-day <a id="Ref_118" href="#BRef_118">so that I</a><span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
may see some of the beauties of your historic
Richmond.”</p>

<p>“Just what I was thinking of, my love,” said
her husband. “You will join us, will you not,
Juliette?”</p>

<p>“Gladly,” she replied, thinking that she would
thereby have another opportunity of testing
Pansy’s identity.</p>

<p>After breakfast Pansy invited her to come upstairs,
where her maid was unpacking her trunks,
saying that she had brought her some presents
from London.</p>

<p>“Of course, as I had never seen you, I could
not have decided what would be most becoming
to you had not my husband assisted me with a
description of your style and tastes,” she said.
And when Juliette saw the beautiful gifts that
had been chosen for her she could not help being
pleased, both with the taste and generosity displayed
by Pansy, whom she thanked quite prettily,
saying:</p>

<p>“I did you an injustice, feeling jealous of
uncle’s love for you, when all the time you were
planning these pleasant surprises for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[120]</span></p>

<p>Pansy hardly knew whether to trust these
sweet protestations or not. She would have liked
to be at peace with Juliette Ives, but she could
not help distrusting her, and she resolved to
watch her closely before she quite discarded her
distrust.</p>

<p>Juliette lay lazily back in a great crimson chair
and watched Phebe, the maid, unpacking Pansy’s
beautiful clothes. She was obliged to own that
she had never seen such a magnificent trousseau
as that with which Colonel Falconer had provided
his lovely bride.</p>

<p>“You are a woman to be envied, Mrs. Falconer,”
she said; and Pansy sighed faintly, although
Juliette could not have told whether the
sigh meant supreme content or some hidden
sorrow.</p>

<p>“She does not look as if she had always been
really happy. There are pensive curves about
her lips when she is not smiling, and now and
then her eyes look anxious,” the girl decided.</p>

<p>In the afternoon an elegant open barouche took
the three out riding, and Colonel Falconer felt
very proud of his beautiful wife and almost<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
equally beautiful niece, in their carriage costumes.</p>

<p>It was a lovely May day, and the city presented
its best appearance under a blue, smiling sky,
which every Virginian believed as fair as that of
Italy. They rode out upon the popular Grove
Road, then the most fashionable drive in the city,
and to that beautiful place, the New Reservoir,
with its bright waters glittering in the sun.
Pansy exclaimed with delight at the miniature
lake, with the water lilies fringing the green
banks, and the little boats rocking on its breast.</p>

<p>Then the beautiful cemetery of Hollywood,
with its magnificent monument to the Confederate
dead, was the next point of interest. Colonel
Falconer then gave the command to drive through
the principal parks and streets.</p>

<p>“Do not forget Seventh Street,” Juliette whispered
to the driver, and when they were rolling
along before an immense structure on that street
she said: “That building, Mrs. Falconer, is the
great tobacco factory of Arnell &amp; Grey. They
employ an immense number of girls and women
to work for them&mdash;twelve hundred at least, I
am told. Would you not like to go through the<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
factory? I presume it would furnish some interesting
sights to one unfamiliar with our Southern
institutions.”</p>

<p>“I dare say it would, but unfortunately the
smell of tobacco always makes me very ill. Colonel
Falconer, cannot we drive faster, so as to escape
this unpleasant odor?” exclaimed Pansy. He
saw that her face had certainly grown very pale,
while her eyes were half closed. He directed the
driver to hasten out of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>“I am sorry it sickened you, but the odor was
strong,” said Juliette. “I do not know how those
poor girls endure it. Their very clothing must
be impregnated with the disagreeable odor. But
perhaps they do not mind it like you and I, Mrs.
Falconer&mdash;useless, fine ladies that we are.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer’s blue eyes flashed, and the color
rushed back into her pale cheeks. She answered,
with a flash of girlish spirit:</p>

<p>“You and I, Miss Ives, are made of the same
clay as those factory girls. We are more fortunate,
that is all.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, Uncle Falconer, I hope your wife
isn’t a socialist!” exclaimed Juliette, shrugging
her shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[123]</span></p>

<p>He frowned, and answered:</p>

<p>“My wife is an angel, Juliette, and has the
kindest, tenderest heart in the world. I’m glad
to hear her speak up for our Richmond working
girls. I have the greatest respect for them all,
as well as sympathy for the poverty that makes
their lot in life so hard. I know also that many
of them are from good families that were reduced
to poverty by the late war.”</p>

<p>Juliette turned her back on him impatiently,
and addressed herself to Pansy:</p>

<p>“You remember how foolishly I behaved last
night, taking you for a girl that disgraced her
family and drowned herself three years ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Pansy answered coldly.</p>

<p>“Well, she was a tobacco-factory girl, and
worked at Arnell &amp; Grey’s. Her name was Pansy
Laurens&mdash;similarity in names, as well as faces,
you see. Your name is Pansy, too, isn’t it? She
was a low, designing creature, and, by her boldness,
caused a rupture between my betrothed and
myself, over which he grieves to this day.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A POISONED LIFE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Bravely as Pansy carried off everything, she
began to fear that her life with Juliette Ives would
never be one of friendship or peace, for the girl
seemed to bristle at all points with poisoned arrows
for her uncle’s wife.</p>

<p>Not that Juliette was outwardly repellent. She
had false, sweet smiles in plenty for Pansy; but
she had also the sharpest claws beneath her silky
fur. She lost no opportunity of wounding, when
she could do so with impunity.</p>

<p>A week passed away, and several of the best
families in the city had called upon Colonel Falconer
and his wife. None saw her but to praise
her wonderful beauty and her graceful ease of
manner; although they had gathered from Juliette
that her origin was obscure, they decided
that she must certainly have been used to good
society, and they made due allowance when Juliette
sneered for her disappointment in losing her
uncle’s money.</p>

<p>But the supreme trial of all had not fallen on<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
her yet. Norman Wylde had not called, although
Juliette had given several intimations
that he would do so soon. Sometimes Pansy
resolved that she would not see him, but
then that course would be sure to excite remark.
The meeting must take place some time, and she
made up her mind at last that she would face it
without a falter.</p>

<p>“I despise him, but I will treat him with the
same courtesy that I do others, that none may
suspect what lies hidden beneath the surface,”
she thought.</p>

<p>She had been home something more than a
week when Colonel Falconer told her one morning,
with a tender caress, that he should have
to leave her to her own devices, or to Juliette’s
society, all day, as he would have to spend some
hours with his lawyers, settling up his sister’s
affairs.</p>

<p>“I have a new book. I will interest myself
in that,” she replied, returning his kiss in her
gentle, affectionate way.</p>

<p>He went away, and, lest Juliette should think
her unsociable, she took her book into the parlor.
It was a warm day, and she wore a lovely morning<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
dress, all white embroidery and lace, with
fluttering loops of blue ribbons. Her lovely dark
hair was drawn into a loose coil on top of her
head, and some curling locks strayed prettily over
her white forehead.</p>

<p>“How pretty you are in that white wrapper,
Mrs. Falconer. I do not see how such a plain
old fellow as my uncle ever induced a beautiful
young girl like you to marry him. But, then,
these rich old fellows can marry any one they
choose!” exclaimed Juliette.</p>

<p>“I do not consider Colonel Falconer old,”
Pansy answered resentfully, but further words
were prevented by the loud ringing of the doorbell.</p>

<p>Juliette sat upright, with a gleam of expectancy
in her pale-blue eyes, and the next moment a
servant appeared at the door, saying that a man
wished to see Mrs. Falconer a few moments.</p>

<p>“Show him in here. It is no doubt some message
from uncle,” quickly exclaimed Juliette.</p>

<p>Instantly there darted into Pansy’s mind a
quick suspicion:</p>

<p>“She has laid another trap for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>And she braced herself to bear anything unflinchingly.</p>

<p>The door opened again, and Mr. Finley, the
grocer, her hated stepfather, entered the room.</p>

<p>Pansy grew pale, but, still holding her book,
she arose in a stately way, fixing on the intruder
a cold glance of inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley, coming in from the outer daylight
into the semigloom of the parlor, did not at first
see very clearly. He bowed profoundly to both
ladies, in an awkward way, and began to speak
briskly:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Falconer, I am a grocer, and enjoyed
the custom and confidence of the late Mrs. Ives.
I have called to solicit&mdash;&mdash;” He stopped and
stared. The beautiful face looking at him struck
him with fear and terror.</p>

<p>He made a retrograde movement toward the
door, keeping his bewildered eyes on her face,
and then he caught a glance from Juliette’s eyes
that suddenly loosened his tongue.</p>

<p>He stopped short, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Heavens, I can’t be mistaken! It&mdash;is&mdash;she!
Mrs. Falconer, excuse me, please, but are you not
my missing stepdaughter, Pansy Laurens?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[128]</span></p>

<p>A gay little laugh trilled over Pansy’s lips as
she blandly assured him that she had never seen
him before in her life, that her maiden name was
Miss Wilcox, and that she was a native of Louisville.</p>

<p>“This is the second time I’ve been told of my
likeness to Pansy Laurens. It is a coincidence,
nothing more. Such things often happen,” she
observed carelessly. “By the way, you called to
solicit custom for your business, I believe. You
may leave your card, and I will refer it to my
husband.”</p>

<p>Thus coolly dismissed, and quite ignoring the
request for his card, Mr. Finley stumbled out,
with a fixed conviction in his mind that Pansy
Laurens had never been drowned at all, but had
married this rich man and come back to triumph
over them all.</p>

<p>He understood now why Juliette had sent him
that little note, saying that her uncle’s wife would
be glad to have him call, as she wished to make
arrangements with him about supplying the family
groceries.</p>

<p>“She recognized her, and wished for me to do
so, unaided by any hint from her,” he thought<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
and wondered: “What ought I to do about it? I
hope I shall see Miss Ives soon, for this discovery
places a mine of gold in my reach, and I must
speedily find out in what way I am to make the
most of it. Miss Ives is poor now, and Norman
Wylde is comparatively so, as he will have no
money until his father dies. I do not know which
I should blackmail&mdash;Falconer or his wife.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN EVENING OF SUSPENSE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Pansy went to dress for dinner she was
so particular that the maid smiled, and thought:</p>

<p>“Her husband has been gone all day, and she
wishes to look her best this evening.”</p>

<p>But Pansy, looking for Norman Wylde’s appearance
every hour, was anxious to appear as
beautiful as possible in the eyes of the man who
had wronged her so deeply.</p>

<p>A lovely dress of cream-colored mull and Valenciennes
lace was donned. The sleeves were
short, and the bodice was a low V neck. She
wore no ornaments, except a diamond locket on
the black velvet band at her throat and a bunch
of creamy-white roses at her slender waist. Thus
attired, she was so dazzlingly lovely when she descended
to the parlor that Juliette fairly hated
her, and could scarcely keep from saying so.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer came in presently, with his
kind, intelligent face and fine military bearing,
and was charmed with the beauty of the two girls,<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
for Juliette looked her best in a dress of black
net with pearl jewelry.</p>

<p>“It is a pity for so much loveliness to be wasted
on an old fellow like me. I hope we shall have
some callers after dinner,” he said gayly.</p>

<p>After dinner he begged Juliette to give them
some music, but, with a malicious glance at Pansy,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I do not like to touch the piano, as I am sure
your wife plays ever so much better than I do.”</p>

<p>Pansy smiled, and answered coolly:</p>

<p>“Then your musical attainments must be very
superficial, indeed, Miss Ives, for I only know
enough of music to play my own accompaniments
to a few songs.”</p>

<p>“Then you will give us a song, won’t you, and
I will play afterward?” cried artful Juliette,
thinking that here, at least, she could outshine
her uncle’s wife.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” Pansy answered carelessly, and
moved toward the piano, secure in her consciousness
of an exquisitely sweet voice, which had had
careful culture when she was a simple schoolgirl,
before her father died.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer leaned against the piano, with<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
his back to the door, and Juliette began to turn
over the piles of music.</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself. I will sing some little
thing from memory,” said Pansy.</p>

<p>Juliette flung herself into an easy-chair and listened
with a sneer, saying to herself:</p>

<p>“I would not try to play if I knew nothing but
a few accompaniments.”</p>

<p>But when that low, sweet, thrilling voice broke
the silence, she started in wonder and delight,
for she was intensely fond of music, and Pansy’s
touch and voice were both exquisite.</p>

<p>No one noticed that the door had opened to admit
visitors, who paused uncertainly on the
threshold, to listen, too, for all were absorbed in
the singer.</p>

<p>At last the white hands dropped from the piano
keys, the thrilling voice became silent. Touched
in spite of herself, Juliette said softly:</p>

<p>“Oh, how sweet and sad! You have brought
tears to my eyes, Mrs. Falconer.”</p>

<p>Before Pansy could reply, all three became
aware that visitors were advancing into the room.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Wylde, I am so glad to see you&mdash;and<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
you, too, Rosalind. Oh, Judge Wylde, it was
so kind of you and Norman to come!” rattled
quickly from Juliette’s lips, as she hastened to
welcome the newcomers.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer also greeted the visitors as if
they were old friends, and hastened to present
his wife.</p>

<p>She, the poor little factory girl whom they had
scorned, stood by her husband’s side like a queen,
and greeted his friends with a calm and stately
dignity that made a profound impression. She
glanced only slightly at Norman Wylde, or she
would have seen that he was terribly agitated.
When their hands touched each other both were
cold as ice.</p>

<p>When all were seated, Pansy saw that he had
retreated to a distant corner, and, as the conversation
proceeded, he took little or no part in
it. He was almost stricken speechless by her
marvelous likeness to one he had loved and lost,
and, but for the interval for thought afforded
him while she was singing, he could not have preserved
his calmness; he must have spoken out on
the spur of the moment, and claimed her, as Mr.
Finley had done, as Pansy Laurens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>When he had first beheld the beautiful face
in profile from the door his senses had almost
reeled; but before her song ceased he had persuaded
himself that he was mistaken in thinking
her the counterpart of Pansy. She was more
beautiful, more distinguished-looking. Pansy had
been very shy and bashful, but this girl held her
small head high. There was a likeness&mdash;a great
one&mdash;but nothing more. One was the wayside
rose, the other the cultivated flower.</p>

<p>From his distant seat he watched the lovely
face and form with a throbbing heart. How the
rich, creamy-hued robe and diamond locket set
off the flowerlike face, with its background of
dark, rippling hair. The beautiful white hands
played with some rose petals she had plucked from
her belt, and he noticed how small they were,
with pink palms and finger tips, dimpled at the
joint, like a child’s. Pansy had had just such
dainty hands, although she was only a working
girl.</p>

<p>“I wish I had not come,” he thought, with
bitter pain. “Mrs. Falconer’s face has brought
everything back. Oh, how am I to bear it? Does
Juliette see the likeness, I wonder? Surely not,<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
or else she could scarcely endure to be haunted
so by the image of one she hated.”</p>

<p>Pansy, on her part, felt a bitter triumph in seeing
that he took such slight notice of Juliette.
Surely he did not care for her, else his eyes would
have wandered to her face sometimes, for it was
plain to be seen that she worshiped him.</p>

<p>“He does not care for her,” Pansy said to herself,
as she saw how carelessly he answered the
remarks Juliette addressed to him. “He has a
fickle heart.”</p>

<p>And she gazed with silent admiration at her
noble husband, who loved her so devotedly, and
who had not been too proud to marry a simple
working girl and lift her to his own station in
life. Although she did not love him in a romantic
fashion, she admired his noble, manly
nature more and more daily.</p>

<p>And she found a bitter satisfaction in seeing
that her betrayer did not look so gay and debonair
as in the past. He was certainly altered; his face
was pale and grave, his eyes were sad and serious.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A RETURN CALL.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Something more than a week after the Wyldes
had called upon the Falconers, Juliette suggested,
one day, that it was time that they should return
the call.</p>

<p>“You and Pansy can do so this afternoon,”
Colonel Falconer replied. “As for me, I cannot
spare a day from those lawyers until I get
through my business, for I am hurrying all I
can, that I may take my family away from the
city before the heated term sets in.”</p>

<p>“Then we will call to-day, and we can then find
out where they intend to summer, for I should
like to go to the same place,” exclaimed Juliette.</p>

<p>So at noon that day they found themselves
ringing the doorbell at a residence on Grace
Street, quite as elegant as the one they had left.
They were shown into an elegant and tasteful
drawing-room, and told that the ladies would be
down directly.</p>

<p>Pansy sat silent, with her eyes fixed on the
door, when suddenly it was pushed ajar by a<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
dimpled little hand, and the figure of a child became
partly visible&mdash;a beautiful child, of perhaps
three years old. The little fellow was simply
clothed, in a white Mother Hubbard slip, and
his big, dark eyes looked fearlessly at the two
ladies.</p>

<p>Pansy’s heart thrilled strangely at sight of the
child, for there was something in his face that
suggested Norman Wylde. Holding out her
hands, she cried coaxingly:</p>

<p>“Come here, you pretty little darling!”</p>

<p>The child hesitated a moment, then pattered
lightly across the carpet with his little bare feet
to her side. She placed him on her knee, and,
clasping him in her arms, kissed the pretty, rosy
face repeatedly.</p>

<p>“What is your name, dear?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Pet!” he replied, while Juliette looked on
coldly.</p>

<p>Apparently the child quite reciprocated the
fancy Mrs. Falconer had shown for him. While
she smoothed his sunny curls with loving hands,
he patted her cheek tenderly, and cooed:</p>

<p>“Pretty yady, pretty yady!”</p>

<p>Suddenly the door unclosed, admitting Mrs.<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
Wylde, the stately matron, and her handsome
daughter, Rosalind. They frowned at sight of
the pretty child, and, after exchanging greetings
with their guests, Rosalind exclaimed sharply:</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, Pet? Get down
this instant, and go away.”</p>

<p>But, to her astonishment, the little one clung
to Pansy, and cried out rebelliously:</p>

<p>“No, no, me stay ’ith pretty yady!”</p>

<p>“The little monkey! He never offered to disobey
me before,” exclaimed Rosalind, frowning,
and she removed him by force from Pansy’s lap,
for he screamed and struggled to stay.</p>

<p>“Oh, please let me keep him. I love children!”
exclaimed Pansy pleadingly; but just here Mrs.
Wylde chimed in:</p>

<p>“You do not quite understand, Mrs. Falconer.
The child belongs to my housekeeper, who adopted
him in infancy. She has her orders to keep him
in her own part of the house, but occasionally
he slips away and intrudes upon us, although this
is the first time he has ever ventured into the
drawing-room.”</p>

<p>“It was my fault. I called him in when I saw
him peeping in at the door. He was such a lovely<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
little child, and I thought he belonged to you,”
said Pansy, as her yearning eyes followed Rosalind,
who was leading the sobbing child from the
room.</p>

<p>“He is a very pretty child, and usually a very
good-tempered, affectionate one,” Mrs. Wylde
acknowledged. “This is the first time I ever saw
him display any temper. Indeed, I have felt myself
on the verge of falling in love with the little
creature often, only I would not allow myself to
do so, being convinced that he must be a child of
shame.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A BEAUTIFUL CHILD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“A child of shame!” Pansy echoed, and a wave
of hot color rushed over her face as she remembered
the little child that had died before its
young mother ever saw its face.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the stately lady, rather coldly.
“He is a foundling, and was left on our steps almost
three years ago. We would have sent it
to the almshouse, but our old housekeeper, who
has been with us so many years that we like to
indulge her some, took a fancy to the little one,
and begged to keep it.”</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful little child. I could not help
falling in love with it,” said Pansy earnestly,
while Juliette sneered:</p>

<p>“It is a pity you have not a child of your own
to love!”</p>

<p>“I wish I had,” Pansy answered. “I am very
fond of children.” And she wished within herself
that she could have little Pet to carry home
with her, for a wild suspicion was growing up
in her heart: What if this were her own child?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>Her mother had told her that her child had
died, but perhaps she had deceived her. Perhaps
Mr. Finley, whom she had always disliked and
distrusted, had taken the child away and forced
her mother to utter that falsehood. What more
natural than that he should have placed it on
the threshold of the Wylde mansion?</p>

<p>Wild suspicion grew almost into agonized certainty
as she recalled the startling likeness of the
child to Norman Wylde.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that his family can fail to see
the likeness in his face?” she wondered, and,
while she held with difficulty her part in the conversation
going forward over the merits of different
summer resorts, she was thinking wildly:</p>

<p>“I do not believe now that my baby died. This
child, with Norman’s eyes, belongs to me. My
heart claimed him the moment he appeared at
the door. And he was fond of me, too. He struggled
so hard to get back to me when Rosalind
forced him away. Oh, I must manage somehow
to see that old housekeeper soon, and find
out all that I can about little Pet.”</p>

<p>“I think I shall go to White Sulphur Springs,”<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
said Mrs. Wylde. “Have you decided where you
shall go, Mrs. Falconer?”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot come to a decision, so I shall
leave it to my husband,” replied Pansy.</p>

<p>“Oh, then you must go to White Sulphur! It
is charming there,” cried Juliette, who wanted
to go wherever the Wyldes went.</p>

<p>“One place will please me quite as well as another,”
Pansy replied indifferently; and when
they took their leave it was quite understood that
the Wyldes and the Falconers were to form a
party for the springs as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“But,” said dark-eyed Rosalind to her mother,
“Juliette is going to be disappointed, for, of
course, she thinks Norman is going with us.”</p>

<p>“Norman must go. It is quite foolish, his
being so stiff with us, and resenting things that
were only done for his good,” Mrs. Wylde replied,
in a displeased tone.</p>

<p>When Pansy and Juliette were riding home,
the latter observed:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Falconer, did you notice what a strong
resemblance that foundling child had to Norman
Wylde?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>Pansy looked at her with a startled air, and
answered:</p>

<p>“You know I’ve only seen Norman Wylde once,
and can’t really recall his features exactly. Does
the child really resemble him? And, if so, what
does it mean?”</p>

<p>“Norman Wylde has lived a very fast life,
you know,” Juliette answered. “I have long suspected
that the child is his own, flung upon his
doorstep in desperation by some one of his victims.
Perhaps he suspects, perhaps he does not&mdash;but
I feel almost certain of its parentage.”</p>

<p>“And the family?” Pansy asked faintly.</p>

<p>“I do not believe they suspect anything. If
they did, they would not permit it to be kept beneath
their roof. They would be perfectly furious,”
replied Juliette, with an air of certainty,
and watching Pansy closely for some signs of
emotion.</p>

<p>But the beautiful girl seemed to grow suddenly
weary of the subject, for she said:</p>

<p>“I wonder if my trousseau will do for the
White Sulphur, or if I ought to order anything
new?”</p>

<p>“You will not need a new thing, nor shall I,<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
as I am in mourning, and cannot dance this season,”
replied Juliette.</p>

<p>As their carriage rolled along Grace Street,
they saw Norman Wylde among the pedestrians
on the pavement. He lifted his hat, and passed
on without stopping, to the chagrin of Juliette,
who hoped he would stop and chat with her a
while.</p>

<p>Her conscience did not reproach her for the
falsehoods she had uttered against his fair fame,
although she knew that there was not a purer,
more high-minded young man in the whole city.
But while she was still uncertain as to the identity
of her uncle’s wife, it suited her best to pretend
that Norman Wylde was dissolute and
guilty. Although she suspected that little Pet
was the child of Pansy Laurens, she was not
certain, and she did not wish Mrs. Falconer to
believe it.</p>

<p>“She will, if she is really Pansy Laurens, hate
him more if she believes that the child is some
other woman’s,” she thought shrewdly, and smiled
when she saw the signs of trouble that Pansy
could not wholly disguise on her fair face.</p>

<p>Poor Pansy! Her heart was well-nigh breaking,<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
and when she reached home she feigned a
headache, that she might have an excuse for shutting
herself up in her own room to think over
the events of to-day, which had aroused suspicions
never to be laid again until they were either confirmed
or proved baseless. The dark eyes of the
little child had aroused the mother’s heart within
her breast, and it ached with a bitter yearning.</p>

<p>“Oh, if my baby did not die, they were cruel
and wicked to deceive me, to cheat me out of
its love all these years! But only let me find out
if that child is mine, and I will have it&mdash;I will!”
she sobbed wildly, in a mood of passionate recklessness.</p>

<p>But suddenly she heard her husband’s voice in
the hall, and shivered.</p>

<p>“Oh, what am I talking of? How dare I claim
my child in the face of everything that is against
me?” she moaned bitterly; and just then Colonel
Falconer entered, with a face full of anxiety.</p>

<p>“They told me you had a headache. Can I do
anything for you, my darling?” he asked tenderly.</p>

<p>“Only love me and pity me,” the girl answered,
almost despairingly, out of her hidden sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<p>He was alarmed at her tone, and feared she
was suffering greatly.</p>

<p>“Let me send for a physician,” he urged.</p>

<p>“No, no, I do not need medicine&mdash;only rest
and quiet,” she pleaded, with a feeling of remorse
in her heart that she could not love him better&mdash;he
was so good and true.</p>

<p>But since she had come back to Richmond, she
was conscious that there was less chance than
ever for her to love her husband in the ardent
fashion to which he had the best claim. Her affection
for him was so calm, so friendly, only,
while, to her dismay, all her old madness had returned
at the first sight of Norman Wylde’s handsome
face.</p>

<p>“Oh what a tyrant love is!” she sighed bitterly.
“I thought I hated him&mdash;I know I ought to hate
him&mdash;yet his face haunts me as it did in those old
days when I loved him first. I dream of him by
night, and I think of him by day, in spite of every
endeavor to forget him. Heaven help me, for I
am wretched!”</p>

<p>Days passed, and Pansy found some relief from
the haunting image of Norman Wylde in thinking
of the little child that she firmly believed to<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
be her own. She struck up a great intimacy with
the Wyldes in hopes of seeing the little one more
frequently; but she was disappointed.</p>

<p>Apparently the housekeeper had received strict
orders, for Pet’s black eyes were no longer to
be seen laughing around the drawing-room door,
nor his footsteps heard pattering through the
halls. There was a sunny plot of grass in the
back yard where he played all day now, except
when he was in that part of the house allotted
to the housekeeper.</p>

<p>But he had never forgotten the “pretty yady,”
and he often asked Mrs. Meade, the housekeeper,
about her, prattling so sweetly that the good old
woman grew quite curious, and at last asked Mrs.
Wylde about Mrs. Falconer.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is very beautiful&mdash;the most beautiful
woman I ever saw,” Mrs. Wylde admitted.
“She took quite a fancy to Pet, and admitted she
was fond of children.”</p>

<p>“He is always talking about her. I never knew
him so fond of any one before,” said Mrs. Meade.
“Did you say she came from California, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Colonel Falconer married her in California,
but she is a native of Kentucky, and was never<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
in Richmond until now,” was the reply, which, if
Mrs. Meade had harbored any suspicion, at once
dissipated.</p>

<p>Still she cherished a desire to see the woman
who had been so kind to her little adopted child
as to win its warm little heart.</p>

<p>“I’d like to thank her for noticing the poor,
forsaken little lamb,” she said to herself. “No
one ever shows it any kindness, except Mr. Norman,
and Heaven knows he ought to love it, for
I firmly believe he is the father, though whether
he suspects it or not, I can’t tell. Anyway, he’s
fond of it, and kind to it.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A DARING MOVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Fate helped Mrs. Meade to the accomplishment
of her wish.</p>

<p>One day all the negro servants had leave of
absence to attend a meeting of some society very
popular with all of their race, and there was no
one left to answer the doorbell but the housekeeper.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mrs. Wylde and Rosalind
went out to do some shopping, and Mrs. Meade
seated herself with Pet in the wide, cool hall,
that she might be within hearing of the bell.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you doin’ to take me on the Capitol
Square dis even’?” queried Pet.</p>

<p>“No, my precious, I can’t take you out to-day,”
answered the kind old woman, putting down her
knitting to caress the beautiful boy, whose sunny
curls and bright black eyes were so dear to her
heart.</p>

<p>“Den I wish dat pretty yady would tum adin,”
exclaimed the child, looking longingly at the front
door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>At that moment there came a hurried, nervous
peal at the doorbell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer had been driving out alone when
she saw Mrs. Wylde and her daughter entering
a store on Broad Street, and she almost instantly
left her carriage and directed the driver to wait
for her, as she desired to do some shopping.</p>

<p>Entering the same store, she bought a box of
handkerchiefs, then, slipping out quietly, she
made her way on foot to Grace Street, scarcely
knowing what she meant to do, but thrilled by a
wild longing to see once more the lovely child that
she believed was her own.</p>

<p>In the absence of the family, she believed that
little Pet might perhaps be permitted the freedom
of the house. She might make some pretext
for entering the house and awaiting Mrs. Wylde’s
return. Thus she might catch a glimpse of the
little one whose charms had won her heart.</p>

<p>She rang the bell with a trembling hand, and,
to her joy and amazement, the first thing she saw
when the door opened was little Pet, clinging to
the dress of the white-haired, kindly looking old
woman who invited her in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>

<p>“Pretty yady! pretty yady!” screamed the child,
and those words acquainted Mrs. Meade with
the fact that Mrs. Falconer stood before her.</p>

<p>“Will you walk in, ma’am? The ladies are out
shopping, but they may come in at any minute,”
she exclaimed eagerly, anxious that little Pet
should have a few minutes at least with the
woman he loved so dearly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer trailed her soft summer silk
through the doorway, and held out her hands to
the eager child.</p>

<p>“Well, I will rest a few minutes, anyhow, as I
walked from Broad Street and feel quite tired,”
she exclaimed, adding gayly: “Oh, how cool and
nice it is here in the hall. I will not go into the
parlor, please.”</p>

<p>She sank down upon the broad antique sofa,
and little Pet, as clean and sweet as a rosebud,
in his little white dress and slippers, climbed into
her lap and clasped his chubby arms about her
neck. Mrs. Meade closed and locked the door,
and began to expostulate with him.</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t scold him! Let him stay with
me. I love children so dearly!” exclaimed Pansy,<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
pressing the child to her heart and kissing him
many times.</p>

<p>Then she looked up a little apprehensively at
the old woman, asking timidly:</p>

<p>“Are you&mdash;his&mdash;mother?”</p>

<p>“No, madam; he’s my adopted child. He was
left at this door almost three years ago, and I
begged the family to let me keep the poor little
forsaken baby for my own. I’m only the housekeeper,
ma’am, and the child’s company for me,”
explained Mrs. Meade, looking curiously into the
beautiful, agitated face before her and wondering
if Mrs. Falconer could possibly know anything
of the child’s parentage, for the tender interest
she took in him seemed very strange.</p>

<p>“Can you remember what month it was when
the child was left here?” queried Pansy eagerly.</p>

<p>“It was on the night of the twenty-eighth of
May, ma’am, and I feel sure it wasn’t more than
an hour old&mdash;a poor little deserted newborn
baby,” said Mrs. Meade, and Pansy sternly repressed
a cry of joy as she hid her startled face
in the boy’s plump neck, pretending to bite him,
that she might hear his vociferous baby laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>“He is mine! It is just as I thought. I was
deceived by my mother, and my child stolen from
me. Oh, what am I to do, for I feel that I cannot
live without him?” she thought wildly.</p>

<p>The little one clung to her, showering her face
with kisses, and filling Mrs. Meade with wonder,
for he was usually very shy of strangers.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see the clothes he wore
when he came here?” she asked, and went away,
returning presently with a bundle, which she
unrolled before Pansy’s eyes.</p>

<p>“See this little linen shirt and gown, so neatly
trimmed with crochet edging, and this fine soft
flannel petticoat,” she said; and Pansy almost
fainted when she saw the selfsame baby garments
on which she had worked, in silence and secrecy,
so many nights when she was at home, a
wretched creature, looking forward with dread
to her baby’s coming.</p>

<p>She wound her arms about the child, and said
faintly:</p>

<p>“You ought to take good care of these things,
for by their aid you might be enabled to trace
the child’s mother some time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>But she flushed deeply when Mrs. Meade answered:</p>

<p>“I mean to take care of them, but I don’t know
as I care to trace the mother. She must be a
hard-hearted creature, to abandon her baby like
she did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t judge her so hardly, please. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;it
was not her fault. They
might have taken it from her,” exclaimed Pansy
pleadingly, then paused in dismay, for, by the
sudden lighting up of Mrs. Meade’s face, she saw
that she had made a mistake in speaking so impulsively.
Anxious to remove any suspicion from
the woman’s mind, she went on apologetically:
“Of course, the mother might have been hard-hearted.
There are plenty such women, but it
does seem strange that any one could desert such
a beautiful child as this one.”</p>

<p>“He is beautiful, and as good and sweet as he
is pretty,” said Mrs. Meade warmly, and Pansy
exclaimed, almost passionately:</p>

<p>“I wish he had been left at my door! I would
certainly have adopted him for my own. I love
him dearly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>“I ’ove oo!” cried little Pet, gazing into her
beautiful face with shining eyes, and she strained
him close to her heart again, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Oh, you sweet little darling!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Meade gazed on the pretty scene with
wonder and suspicion, asking herself why Mrs.
Falconer and the child were so strongly attached
to each other. She knew that Norman Wylde
had been in trouble several years before on account
of a pretty factory girl, who was reported
to have drowned herself, but she had never
heard that there was a child in the case. She
wondered now if that unfortunate girl had looked
like Mrs. Falconer.</p>

<p>“I mean to find out,” she resolved, just as
Pansy looked up and asked pleadingly:</p>

<p>“Won’t you give me this child if my husband
will allow me to adopt him? I will be like a
mother to him, educate him, bring him up to a
noble manhood, if he lives.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to go with the lady, and leave
your poor old Meade, my pet?” exclaimed the
housekeeper, and the little one murmured a delighted
affirmative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>“You see!” cried Pansy triumphantly. “Now,
may I have him?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Meade shook her head.</p>

<p>“Colonel Falconer would never permit you to
have him,” she said.</p>

<p>“My husband has never refused a request of
mine in our whole acquaintance,” cried Pansy
impatiently.</p>

<p>“But he would refuse this,” said Mrs. Meade.
“You will have some children of your own some
time, Mrs. Falconer, then this poor little one
would be thrust aside. No, no&mdash;I could not part
with him, even to one who likes him as much as
you do, dear lady.”</p>

<p>Pansy gazed at her with a grieved and baffled
air. Her red under lip quivered and tears started
to her beautiful eyes. For a moment she could
not speak, so bitter was her disappointment; and
Mrs. Meade folded up the tiny garments in an
embarrassed fashion, ashamed of refusing the
lady’s request, but feeling that she was acting
for the best.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bright thought came to Pansy.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Meade, I see that you love Pet too well<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
to give him up,” she said gently. “I don’t blame
you, for I love him dearly myself. But couldn’t
you come and be my housekeeper? Then I could
see him every day.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Meade threw up her hands in dismay.</p>

<p>“Leave the Wyldes!” she cried. “Oh, my dear
young lady, I’ve kept house for them these
twenty-five years, and to leave them now would
be like pulling up an old tree by the roots. I’m
too old to be transplanted. I should die.”</p>

<p>Pansy clasped the child close to her aching
heart with a cry of despair that she could not
repress.</p>

<p>“Oh, my little darling, my little darling, I shall
see you no more, then! Fate is too strong for
us,” she cried.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meade took off her spectacles and wiped
the moisture of tears from them. She was deeply
touched by Pansy’s affection for Pet, and, after
a moment, she said significantly:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Falconer, I’m sorry to seem harsh and
unkind, refusing to give you the child, but I know
you will forget it directly. While, as for me,
my heart is bound up in him, and I’ve always
said that I’d never give up my claim, except to<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
some one who had a better right to him than I
have.”</p>

<p>Pansy glanced up, startled, and met the significant
gaze of the kind old eyes. She understood.</p>

<p>With a burning blush, she put the little one
out of her arms and rose to go.</p>

<p>“Then, of course, I can urge you no longer.
Your claim is too strong,” she said, trying to
speak coldly, as a mask for her bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>“As for not seeing Pet any more, Mrs. Falconer,
if you care about it I can make it easy
enough for you to see him. I take him to the
Capitol Square every pleasant afternoon,” said
Mrs. Meade; and then she asked eagerly; “Won’t
you come in the parlor and play the piano for Pet?
He loves music so dearly.”</p>

<p>“I ought to go this minute,” she said, but
yielded to the tiny, persuasive little fingers that
clasped hers, and stayed almost an hour longer,
playing and singing for the delighted little one.</p>

<p>When she took leave she slipped a golden coin
in the baby fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>“To buy candy,” she said, kissing him fondly,
and promising to come to the Capitol Square the
next afternoon to see him. Then she tore herself
away, and Mrs. Meade had hard work to
console Pet, who wept bitterly at the parting.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">OLD LOVERS FACE TO FACE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>How strange it seemed to Pansy to be going
again, after the lapse of more than three years,
to the Capitol Square to meet one whom she loved,
but whom she must see in secret because a cruel
fate kept them sundered in life, but one in heart.
Then it was the father&mdash;now it was the child.</p>

<p>While she was wondering how she was to get
away from the lynx eyes of her husband’s niece,
Juliette came in to say that she would like to have
the phaëton for her own use that afternoon, if
Mrs. Falconer was not going out.</p>

<p>“One of my dearest friends, Miss Norwood,
is just home from a long visit in New York, and
I would like so much to take her for a drive,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Pray do so. I shall not need the phaëton this
afternoon,” Pansy answered eagerly.</p>

<p>“You are not going out yourself?” Juliette
asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Should I do so, it will only be
for a short walk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>Juliette thanked her and hastened away.</p>

<p>“Colonel Falconer is busy with his lawyer,
Juliette away, and the field clear. I will go and
see my child,” she thought gladly.</p>

<p>It was July, and the day was warm and sultry.
Pansy dressed herself simply, in a plain white
dress and leghorn hat, and, taking a large sun-shade
in her hand, started for the Capitol Square.</p>

<p>Her heart throbbed painfully as she walked
slowly along the old familiar streets, thinking of
those past days, so full of love and pain.</p>

<p>It was only four o’clock when she reached the
square, and the nurses and children were just beginning
to come in. She looked everywhere, but
there was no sign of Mrs. Meade and little Pet.</p>

<p>“I am too early. I must sit down in some
quiet, secluded spot and wait,” she thought, and
sought a shady seat on the slope of the hill back
of the Capitol building.</p>

<p>“It was here we sat that day when Norman
told me he was going to London,” she murmured
sadly, and then she recoiled with a sudden
cry:</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>The quiet bench she sought was already occupied,
and by Norman Wylde himself.</p>

<p>She could scarcely repress a wild and passionate
cry of pain and reproach. As it was, she
dared not trust herself, and turned to flee.</p>

<p>But Norman Wylde had been aroused from a
deep abstraction by her low exclamation of dismay,
and, starting up, he confronted her, coming
out of such a mood that he for a moment fancied
his lost love had come back from the other world
to comfort his sad heart. A glad cry came from
his lips:</p>

<p>“Pansy!”</p>

<p>That name arrested her footsteps. She paused,
frightened, moveless. Had he recognized her?
Would he tax her with her identity?</p>

<p>“Pansy!” he repeated tenderly, and, although
she trembled and grew faint at the passion in
his voice, it came to her suddenly that she must
make some defense for herself. She, the honored
wife of the proud Colonel Falconer, must
never own herself to be that Pansy Laurens
whom the man before her had deceived and betrayed.
She would be brave and proud for her
husband’s sake, as well as for her own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>

<p>Steeling her heart and her nerves as well as
she could, she turned toward him, saying coldly:</p>

<p>“It is quite true, Mr. Wylde, that my name is
Pansy, but as you and I have never met but once
before to-day, it seems to me that I should be
Mrs. Falconer to you.”</p>

<p>Norman Wylde could only stare for a moment
with bewildered eyes at the lovely speaker, and
mutter helplessly:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Falconer!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied coldly, and suddenly he
struck his hand against his forehead, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I am a fool, a madman! Madam, pardon
me. I&mdash;I&mdash;was mistaken.” Then, seeing that
she lingered, he added, with an imploring gesture:
“Will you not sit down here for one moment
and let me explain?”</p>

<p>She knew quite well that she ought not to stay,
but she could not turn from him. She sank down
on the rustic bench and waited with throbbing
pulses for an explanation. What would he say&mdash;what
could he say?</p>

<p>He sat down beside her, pale with emotion, but
so splendidly handsome in his cool summer suit<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
and spotless linen that her heart throbbed madly,
and she thought:</p>

<p>“Oh, my false love! How grandly handsome,
how winning you are! It is no wonder that I
lost my heart to you, innocent child that I was!
Oh, would that you had been true and good, as
well as fascinating.”</p>

<p>But no one who saw how coldly and proudly
her blue eyes looked at him would have thought
that such passionate thoughts thrilled her heart.
He himself believed that she was bitterly angry,
and he hastened to say deprecatingly:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Falconer, you are so startlingly like one
I used to know that when you appeared before
me I did not remember you as Mrs. Falconer,
and I called you by that name unwittingly. No
offense to you was intended. I did not know that
you were called Pansy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is my name. I was Pansy Wilcox
when Colonel Falconer married me. And so you
say that I resemble some one you used to know,
Mr. Wylde? How strange!” Pansy said, trying
to draw him into some reminiscences of the past,
womanlike, wishing to know whether he remembered
her with love or remorse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[165]</span></p>

<p>He sighed heavily, and answered:</p>

<p>“Yes, you are the image of one I loved and
lost. Do you remember the night I came to your
house, Mrs. Falconer? I came very near calling
you Pansy then&mdash;I was so startled at the first
sight of your face. But while you were singing
I recovered myself so that I could greet you
calmly. It was different just now, for I was
thinking of that other Pansy, and you came upon
me so suddenly that I had no time for thought,
and I called you by her name.”</p>

<p>“It was some one you loved?” Pansy said, in
a low, soft voice.</p>

<p>“Loved!” exclaimed Norman Wylde hoarsely,
and his dark eyes seemed to burn into her soul
as he added: “Love is hardly the word. I worshiped,
adored my little Pansy.”</p>

<p>“Did she die?” asked Pansy gently.</p>

<p>“Yes, she died,” he replied hoarsely; then, pausing
abruptly: “Has not Juliette Ives told you all
about it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It is a wonder,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“You make me quite curious. I think unfortunate
love affairs are so sad and romantic. Was<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
yours unfortunate, Mr. Wylde?” asked Pansy,
still leading him on.</p>

<p>“It was tragic,” he answered gloomily; and she
was glad when she saw he was suffering some
remorse for the ill that he had wrought. Her
heart began to grow softer toward him.</p>

<p>“He is sorry for his sin. Perhaps he would
undo it if he could,” whispered her heart.</p>

<p>Norman Wylde lifted his sad, dark eyes and
looked at her gravely. Oh, how strong was the
resemblance to his lost love, and how strangely
his heart thrilled at the sound of her voice! No
one but Pansy Laurens had ever made his heart
beat faster by a voice of music.</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me all about it,” she
said persuasively.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN OLD STORY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pansy had quite forgotten why she came to
the Capitol Square. She could think of nothing
but Norman Wylde and the sorrow on his handsome
face. She lingered beside him until he consented
to tell her the story of his unhappy love
affair.</p>

<p>“I was engaged to Juliette Ives, but I was not
very much in love with her. I met, in the country,
a beautiful young girl named Pansy Laurens,”
he said. “The young lady was not in our
set. She was poor, and worked at Arnell &amp; Grey’s
tobacco factory; but she was the fairest, sweetest,
most charming little creature I ever met. We fell
in love at first sight, and I broke my engagement
with Juliette for her sake. But, of course, you
think, as every one else did, Mrs. Falconer, that I
acted badly.”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked searchingly into her
pale face. Oh, how like it was to his lost love’s,
only with a proud smile on it that made it a<span class="pagenum">[168]</span>
little different from Pansy’s, that had been so
sweet and gentle.</p>

<p>“I am very much interested; please go on,” she
murmured. And, sighing heavily, Norman
Wylde continued:</p>

<p>“Of course, everybody set themselves against
us, Pansy’s relations as well as mine.”</p>

<p>Pansy trembled, for the deep, sweet, thrilling
voice went to her heart, which began to beat
heavily and painfully. How her thoughts went
back to the past, when he had been her worshiped
lover, and she had thought him true!</p>

<p>“We met in secret, my sweet little love and I,”
continued Norman, “but we could not see each
other very often, because she had to work in the
factory all the week. But on Sundays I saw her
at church, and in the afternoons she would come
here, or to Libby Hill Park, always to a different
place, that no one might suspect us. I would have
married her at once, but we should have had nothing
to live on, as I had no clients yet, and my father
had threatened to disinherit me if I did not
give her up. But I vowed in secret that I would
not do that, and, at last, fate&mdash;as I thought&mdash;opened
out a way for us to be happy. I found a<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
client who wished me to go to Europe and manage
an important case.”</p>

<p>“And you went?” she asked, for he paused so
long that she feared his confidences were at an
end.</p>

<p>“Yes, I went,” he answered slowly; then he
looked at her gravely, and said: “You are a
stranger, Mrs. Falconer, and there is something
connected with my trip to London that I should
not betray, perhaps, for the sake of my family.”</p>

<p>“Whatever you tell me will be held sacred,”
she said, almost inaudibly, and the dark eyes
looked at her in a sort of wonder.</p>

<p>“I ought not to betray this to any one but a
dear friend,” he said hesitatingly. “Mrs. Falconer,
I wonder if you could like me well enough
to be my friend? It would be very pleasant to
me. You look so much like her that I should find
comfort in your friendship.”</p>

<p>Many and many a time Pansy Laurens had said
to herself that Norman Wylde was the greatest
enemy she had on earth. But now she held out
her hand to him, in its soft silken glove, and he
took it and pressed it eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>“I will be your friend,” she said, wondering
if he was going to confess to her now about the
secret marriage that was no marriage, after all.
She was so curious to hear how he would justify
that that she did not hesitate to promise him her
friendship.</p>

<p>But, to her wonder and indignation, he skipped
quite over that important era in his love affair,
and went on telling her about his trip to London:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Falconer, that tour on which I prided
myself was a plot, a trap, laid by my parents to
get me away from Richmond and from Pansy.
My client was a paid tool of my father’s, and his
craft followed me to London, where, for almost
a year, I remained, vainly seeking links in a case
that never had existed, save in the fertile brain
of those who invented that pretext for the purpose
of luring me away from home and love. My
brain whirls yet when I recall how I was duped
and deceived, my life and hers made pitiable
wrecks for the sake of a despicable pride of birth
and position.”</p>

<p>His agitation was terrible for the moment. His
dark eyes blazed, great drops of perspiration
started out on his pallid brow. As for her, she<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
could not speak; she sat staring at him with
parted lips and blue eyes full of misery.</p>

<p>“Oh, I ought not to have gone back to that
time, for it stirs the smoldering ashes into fire
again,” he cried bitterly. “Think, Mrs. Falconer,
how I suffered all that time, never hearing a
word from my darling, although I wrote to her
every week, and she had promised to write to me.
And, at last&mdash;oh, Heaven!&mdash;there came to me a
Richmond paper, saying that she had drowned
herself.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” sighed Pansy sympathetically, but he
did not seem to hear her. His head drooped, and
his eyes sought the ground. He seemed to be
oblivious to all but his own pain.</p>

<p>For her, she was thinking bitterly:</p>

<p>“I am glad he is capable of some remorse for
his sin. It makes me think a little more kindly of
him.”</p>

<p>Then she shuddered at herself, for she knew
that she was thinking of him more than kindly&mdash;fast
falling under the old glamour&mdash;and she knew
this must not be, that she ought to fly as from the
tempting of a serpent. She made a motion to
rise, but he looked up quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>“Do not go&mdash;yet,” he said pleadingly. “Somehow,
it is a sad pleasure to me to see you sitting
there, with that face so like poor dead Pansy’s
that it brings back all the perished past.”</p>

<p>At those words she could not rise. She seemed
to have no volition of her own. She sat still, comparing
herself to a bird charmed by a serpent.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” he went on, “we sat here on
the very bench one Sunday, just a week before I
sailed for England. She wore a white dress and
wide straw hat, something like you wear now. I
told her of my good fortune, but, poor child, a
presentiment seemed to come over her gentle
spirit, and she wept most bitterly because I was
going away.”</p>

<p>“He will tell me now of that most shameful
marriage,” Pansy thought; but again she was
mistaken.</p>

<p>“Poor little darling! No wonder she felt so
gloomy, for our parting was the knell of her fate,”
said Norman Wylde. “I feel quite sure that by
some underhand means our letters to each other
were suppressed, for not a line ever came to me,
though I shall never doubt that she wrote often,
and I feel quite certain that it was the agony of<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
suspense and hope deferred that drove her to
suicide.”</p>

<p>“You came home, then, did you not?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“No; for I could not have borne to return and
find her gone. What was there to come back to,
Mrs. Falconer? Not even a grave, for her body
was never recovered from the river.”</p>

<p>He raised his downcast eyes and looked into
her face with such a searching expression that
she trembled lest he was going to tax her with
her identity.</p>

<p>But he did not do so. He only said:</p>

<p>“I was too miserable and distracted to come
home then. Besides, I had not yet discovered
the fraud that had been perpetrated on me. I
stayed in London almost a year longer, vainly
prosecuting my search for the missing links in
my client’s case, and then, by accident, I found
out how I had been deceived. I came home at
once then, and taxed my parents with the truth.
They acknowledged the deception, but claimed
that it had been done for my good, and begged
my pardon. I would not forgive them, yet, for
the sake of family pride, I kept secret their perfidy,<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
and you are the first one to whom it has
been revealed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what a sad, what a miserable ending for
so sweet a love story! It seems a pity you did not
marry the girl and take her away with you!”
cried Pansy.</p>

<p>“I wish that I had done so, for then I might
have been happy, instead of the most miserable
and remorseful man in the whole world,”
groaned Norman Wylde; and she wondered how
much of this was acting and how much reality.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he loved me better than he knew, and
repented when too late the miserable betrayal that
wrecked my life,” she thought, softening more
and more toward him whom she knew she ought
to hate.</p>

<p>But before either one could utter another word,
the prattling voice of a little child was heard,
and Pansy looked up and saw Mrs. Meade and
little Pet coming along the path toward where
she sat.</p>

<p>Pet caught sight of the two sitting there together,
and ran forward with a cry of delight.</p>

<p>“Pretty yady, pretty yady!” he cried joyously,
and climbed into Pansy’s lap and kissed her.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE ENEMY AT WORK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Norman Wylde seemed almost petrified with
amazement at the scene before him. He gazed
in wonder at Pansy and the child, and from them
to Mrs. Meade.</p>

<p>The old housekeeper, on her part, was surprised,
too. She scarcely knew what to make
of finding Norman Wylde here with Mrs. Falconer,
but she knew not what to say. She could
only stand and stare with a look of wonder on
her fat face, which was flushed crimson from
walking in the hot sun.</p>

<p>Perhaps Pansy understood something of the
surprise she was exciting in Norman Wylde’s
mind, for the color rose warmly into her face as
she returned the child’s caress and arose in a
hasty way, gently putting him down upon the
seat, and turning toward Mrs. Meade.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mrs. Meade. I am glad you
have brought your sweet little boy out for a holiday,”
she exclaimed, adding sweetly: “I wish I
could stay for another romp with him, such as I<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
had the other day. But I have an engagement in
a few minutes. Good afternoon, Mr. Wylde. I
have quite enjoyed my little chat with you while
I rested under these beautiful trees.”</p>

<p>He rose and bowed courteously, giving her a
glance of grave friendliness that made her heart
beat faster as she walked away, leaving all her
heart behind her with her child and the father of
her child, for&mdash;guilty wretch though she believed
him&mdash;she could not strangle her yearning love.</p>

<p>“I believe that he is sorry for his sin,” she
kept telling herself, as some palliative of her tenderness
for him, when suddenly she heard quick
footsteps behind her and a hand stealthily touched
her elbow.</p>

<p>“He has followed me,” she thought, with some
alarm, and turned her head quickly.</p>

<p>Then a low cry of dismay and anger came
from her lips.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley, the grocer, her feared and hated
stepfather, was walking along by her side, leering
wickedly down into her face with an air of
recognition that almost made her heart stop its
beating.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Pansy. I am glad to see that<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
you are making it up with your old lover. I was
behind a tree, watching you two while you sat
on that bench talking. You find the old love as
sweet as ever, eh? Well, no one can blame you
for not loving that old man you married for his
money,” were the impertinent words that greeted
her astonished ears.</p>

<p>She drew herself up haughtily, and tried to
freeze him with her indignant glance.</p>

<p>“Get out of my path, you wretch! How dare
you persist in pretending to recognize me as some
one you have known?” she exclaimed angrily;
but he only laughed, and, staying close by her
side, retorted:</p>

<p>“Somebody else recognized you as some one he
had known before, too, Mrs. Falconer. Didn’t I
hear Norman Wylde calling you Pansy an hour
or so ago, when you first came up to him?”</p>

<p>She trembled with horror at the accusation, but,
remembering that she had not admitted the truth
to Norman Wylde, took courage.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Resemblances are common,” she
said carelessly. “I do not deny that Mr. Wylde
took me for some one else, but he immediately<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
apologized for his mistake, and if you had the
instincts of a gentleman you would do the same.”</p>

<p>“But I have not made a mistake,” leered Finley.
He kept along by her side, although she was
walking fast, and continued: “Pansy, you had
as well own up to me, for I have recognized you,
and I mean to make money out of my knowledge.
I am poor, and I have your mother and sisters
to support. You are rich, and you must give me
some money for them, or I will betray you to
your husband.”</p>

<p>Although Pansy trembled inwardly at his bold
threat, she determined that she would not yield to
his demands.</p>

<p>“Once own that I am Pansy Laurens, and all
is lost. I could never satisfy the man’s rapacity,
and he would only betray me at last. Besides, he
cannot prove my identity; he only suspects it,”
she thought wisely; and, to his angry astonishment,
she laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>“Why are you laughing?” he demanded; and,
lifting her bright face defiantly, she answered:</p>

<p>“I am pleased because I see a policeman up
there near the governor’s mansion, and I am going
to give you into custody for annoying me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>He followed her glance and grew pale as he
saw the blue-coated custodian of the law pacing
along the walk she indicated. Stopping short,
he growled fiercely:</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t dare!”</p>

<p>“You will see, my clever friend,” she replied
airily, also stopping and looking up at him again
so coolly that he wondered at her unconcern.</p>

<p>“You had better leave me,” she said calmly,
though white to the lips with anger. “I do not
desire to have you arrested, for I know my husband
would have you punished to the full extent
of the law. He knows all about my past, and
your talk of betrayal is the senseless chatter of
a madman. Will you go now, or shall I call
the policeman, or any of these gentlemen sitting
around?”</p>

<p>He was baffled by her cool assumption of fearlessness,
for he did not dare to drive her to bay.
No one knew so well as himself what cause he
had to dread exposure.</p>

<p>Glowering fiercely on her from his small, beady
black eyes, he hissed, low and threateningly:</p>

<p>“I am going now, but not that I’m afraid of
you, nor that policeman, either, only for your<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
mother’s sake, because it would break her heart
to know that her shameless child was still alive.
But you will hear from me again&mdash;remember
that, my saucy madam, and live in fear of my
vengeance.”</p>

<p>“I am not in the least afraid of you, and I am
going to call that policeman this minute,” Pansy
answered, walking briskly away; and, to her joy,
Mr. Finley turned and walked quickly off, going
out of the square at a gate directly opposite.</p>

<p>“He is a coward, despite his threats, and he will
not trouble me again, I hope,” she murmured,
leaving the square and going quickly toward home
with no other drawback, except meeting several
factory girls going home from work whose faces
were perfectly familiar to her, and who had not
forgotten hers, either, for one nudged the other
and exclaimed audibly:</p>

<p>“Good gracious, the very image of poor Pansy
Laurens!”</p>

<p>Pansy’s heart gave a wild throb, and she hurried
past the girls, thinking:</p>

<p>“I ought never to have come back here. I am
not changed as I thought I was. Every one knows
my face, and I fear trouble will come of it yet.<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
Suppose I were to meet my mother, or sisters,
for instance, and they were to claim me, I do
not believe I could be brave enough to deny my
identity.”</p>

<p>That night she begged her husband to hurry
up his business, that he might take her away from
the city.</p>

<p>“It is so warm and sultry here that I am almost
afraid I shall fall ill if I stay,” she said;
and he, remembering her headache of a few days
before, took alarm at once.</p>

<p>“It is very vexatious, this law business. My
sister’s affairs were in a terribly tangled condition,
and I’m afraid it will be several days yet
before I can get away,” he said; then, smiling
and encircling the graceful figure with his arm,
he added; “But that is no reason, my darling,
that you and Juliette should remain here. Both
of you are quite ready to go, you say. Then why
not start to White Sulphur to-morrow, and let
me follow when I get through my task here?”</p>

<p>Her heart leaped with joy, then she inwardly
chided herself for her eagerness to leave him.</p>

<p>“It would not be kind to leave you&mdash;and&mdash;I
should miss you so,” she murmured, speaking<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
quite truthfully, for she had a gentle affection
for him still, in spite of the truant heart that
fluttered so at the very thought of Norman
Wylde.</p>

<p>“But if I can get away from Richmond I shall
not think so often of him, and I can be truer in
heart to my husband,” she thought, for she had
heard the Wyldes say that Norman would not
consent to accompany them.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer was pleased at the knowledge
that she would miss him, but he declared that he
was afraid she would be sick if she remained any
longer in the city.</p>

<p>“And as I cannot get away yet, you must not
wait for me any longer. You can write to me
every day, and that will be some consolation for
your absence,” he said.</p>

<p>Juliette was delighted when she heard that they
were not to wait for her uncle. She hurried
around to the Wyldes the next morning to persuade
them to go, too, and was successful in her
mission.</p>

<p>“Only Norman says he can’t get away from
his business this summer,” said Rosalind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>“And he won’t go?” Juliette asked, bitterly
disappointed.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well. There will be plenty of other
beaus!” Juliette said, tossing her head and pretending
to be indifferent. “Well, it is settled
that we meet at the depot this evening, Mrs.
Wylde?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the lady; and Juliette hurried
home to make her arrangements, and to vent
her spleen on Norman Wylde by saying to Pansy:</p>

<p>“Norman Wylde won’t go because I have
treated him so coldly, Rosalind says; but he may
sulk all he chooses. I shall not make up with him
in a hurry.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“A MARRIED FLIRT.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Pansy had left Norman Wylde, Mrs.
Meade sat down on the seat she had vacated,
and her face was very grave and thoughtful.</p>

<p>It had appeared very strange to her to find
Norman Wylde and the beautiful Mrs. Falconer
alone in the park together, and seeming to be on
very amicable terms with each other, whereas
she had supposed them to be almost utter
strangers.</p>

<p>“Perhaps she is a flirt,” she thought suspiciously;
and just then Norman Wylde turned his
head, after watching Pansy until she disappeared,
and said:</p>

<p>“How does it happen that Mrs. Falconer and
Pet are so well acquainted with each other?”</p>

<p>The old housekeeper, who had known him ever
since he was a little boy, answered dryly:</p>

<p>“Mr. Norman, I was just going to ask the same
question about yourself and Mrs. Falconer.”</p>

<p>He smiled at first, then flushed a dark red at
her searching glance, and answered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[185]</span></p>

<p>“But I do not know Mrs. Falconer very well.
I have never met her but once or twice until she
came down this path, quite by accident, a while
ago, and I invited her to rest a few minutes&mdash;she
looked so tired and warm.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid she was one of them married
flirts that’s getting so fashionable nowadays,”
muttered Mrs. Meade.</p>

<p>“A married flirt! No, indeed! I believe Mrs.
Falconer is as pure and sweet and shy as a child.
She is so much like one I knew years ago that
she could not be otherwise,” exclaimed Norman
Wylde earnestly, as he fondled Pet, who had
crept to his knee, thus consoling himself for the
departure of his “pretty yady.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Meade looked up, all eager interest.</p>

<p>“Like some one you knew?” she exclaimed
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, with a heavy sigh, and the
housekeeper asked coaxingly:</p>

<p>“Would you mind telling me whom she looked
like, Mr. Norman?”</p>

<p>“Curiosity, thy name is woman!” he said, with
a low laugh, half dreary amusement, half bitterness;
then, with another sigh, he went on: “Mrs.<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
Meade, I suppose you know all about my unfortunate
love affair of three years ago?”</p>

<p>She nodded, and then he said:</p>

<p>“This beautiful Mrs. Falconer is the image of
the girl I loved, and from whom my parents
parted me. She committed suicide by drowning
within a year after I went away, you remember?”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed the old housekeeper, and her
face began to glow with excitement.</p>

<p>“Mr. Norman, are you sure she drowned herself?”
she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Sure!” he repeated, turning toward her, with
wondering eyes. “Why, what do you mean, Mrs.
Meade?”</p>

<p>“Was her body ever recovered from the river?”
retorted the housekeeper significantly.</p>

<p>He started violently, then answered:</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“So I thought,” said Mrs. Meade, and, following
up her train of thought, she added: “There
isn’t any possibility that Mrs. Falconer can be
the same girl, is there, Mr. Norman?”</p>

<p>He sprang from his seat, pushing Pet unconsciously
from him, and confronted her, pale with
surprise and excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[187]</span></p>

<p>“You must be mad!” he exclaimed. “This lady
was one of the belles of Louisville&mdash;never was
in Richmond until this summer, I am told.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, Mr. Norman, and forgive me for
talking like an old fool, although maybe I’m not
such a fool, after all,” answered Mrs. Meade.
But he would not sit down again; he remained
standing in front of her and looking down consciously
into her agitated face as she continued,
in a low, grave voice:</p>

<p>“Being such an old woman, Mr. Norman, and
knowing you ever since you was no bigger than
Pet here, you needn’t mind my asking you questions
that might be impertinent from some people.”</p>

<p>“Ask what you please, Mrs. Meade. I am
too much your friend to take offense at your plain
speaking,” he replied encouragingly; and, without
any further preamble, she queried:</p>

<p>“In that unfortunate love affair of yours, Mr.
Norman, was there any prospect of&mdash;a&mdash;child?”</p>

<p>“No!” he answered quickly, almost angrily, yet
she saw the hot color shoot up to his brow, and
his glance fell before hers.</p>

<p>She sighed, and exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<p>“Then I’m all at sea again, for, to tell you the
truth, Mr. Norman, I’ve been half believing all
this time that Pet here was your own child!”</p>

<p>He started as if shot, and, dropping into a seat
again, caught Pet’s hand and drew him forward,
scrutinizing his beautiful features with eager
eyes:</p>

<p>“Can’t you see that he has your eyes, your
features?” exclaimed Mrs. Meade triumphantly,
and, with something like a groan, he muttered:</p>

<p>“And something of her, too!” he said. “That
smile, those dainty dimples, how like, how like!
Now I understand what drew my heart so
strongly to the child. Mrs. Meade,” looking up
at her with blazing eyes, “you must answer now
the question I asked you first: How is it that
Pet and Mrs. Falconer know each other so well?”</p>

<p>And, for answer, she began at the first meeting
of Mrs. Falconer and the child, and related all
that had taken place since, dwelling strongly on
their mutual passionate attachment for each
other, and on the lady’s eager desire to adopt the
child.</p>

<p>“I will tell you the truth, Mr. Norman: I
strongly suspect that this beautiful lady is the<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
child’s own mother, and if there is no chance that
the little one can be yours, why, then I ought to
let her have him, maybe. I refused because I
thought he was yours,” she said.</p>

<p>“You were right not to let her have him,” he
exclaimed hurriedly. Then his face dropped into
his hands a moment, and passers-by looked curiously
at the old woman, the pretty child, and
the handsome man bowed in an attitude of deep
dejection.</p>

<p>Little Pet was so grieved at the man’s sorrowful
attitude that he went up to him and encircled
Norman’s neck with his chubby arms, and inquired
tenderly:</p>

<p>“Oo kyin’ tause pretty yady gone?”</p>

<p>The young man caught him in his arms, straining
him to his breast, and again gazed eagerly into
his lovely face.</p>

<p>“My little darling, what if it were to prove
true?” he muttered hoarsely; then, looking around
at Mrs. Meade, he asked:</p>

<p>“Do you know where Mrs. Laurens, the mother
of poor little Pansy, lives?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not know,” she replied; and a look
of bitter disappointment came over his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></p>

<p>“I have been trying ever since I came home to
trace that woman,” he exclaimed. “I remember
that just before I went away she was married a
second time, and went on a bridal tour with her
husband. But I do not know the name of the
person she married, nor where she is living now,
for she has moved away from where she resided
when I went away.”</p>

<p>Was it fate, or only a blind chance, for at that
moment there came along the walk a plainly
dressed, stooping figure, with a sad, worn face
that had once been very pretty, though now faded
and forlorn. Norman had seen Pansy’s mother
only once, but he recognized her again in this
passer-by, and, springing to his feet, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Laurens!”</p>

<p>The pale, sad-looking creature recoiled from
him with a frightened denial:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;that is not my name!”</p>

<p>Norman caught her wrist in a firm yet tender
clasp, for she was trying to get away.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he said sternly. “Denials are useless,
for I know that you are Mrs. Laurens, and I think
you know that I am Norman Wylde. I was just
speaking about you and wishing I knew where<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
to find you. I want you to tell me the truth about
this child here. Is it not your daughter Pansy’s?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;oh, no!” she exclaimed wildly; but just
then Mrs. Meade exclaimed surprisedly:</p>

<p>“La, me, that’s the very woman I have seen
dozens of times, hanging about when I took Pet
out, but never mistrusted who she was!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens looked at her imploringly, and
faltered out:</p>

<p>“You must be mistaken. I never saw you before,
ma’am.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” ejaculated the housekeeper,
and little Pet himself gave the lie to Mrs. Laurens’
denial, for he came to her with a smile, and
cooed sweetly:</p>

<p>“Is oo dot any more tandy to-day?”</p>

<p>“You see, the child knows you. Confess the
truth now! Are you not his own grandmother?”
exclaimed Norman, low but eagerly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Laurens writhed under his grasp, and
looked from right to left with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>“Answer me!” persisted Norman. But a
dogged look came over her face, and she replied:</p>

<p>“No, my daughter Pansy never had a child.
Why do you want to throw disgrace on my poor<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
dead girl?” And she suddenly burst into tears,
and, tugging at his hand, wailed out: “Oh, let me
go! I promised to meet my daughter Alice when
she was coming home from the factory, and&mdash;and&mdash;it’s
past the closing time now.”</p>

<p>“Will you swear that this is not Pansy’s child?”
Norman insisted hoarsely; but at that moment
she succeeded in freeing her hand from his clasp
and darted away like a startled deer. Not wishing
to create a sensation, he had to refrain from
following her.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE BLACKMAILER BAFFLED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Finley had left Pansy and sought his home
again in a tempest of fury and baffled cupidity,
realizing fully that his scheme of blackmailing her
would not succeed, and that he must look elsewhere
for booty.</p>

<p>Pansy’s dauntless bravery and defiance had
certainly staggered his bold courage, and he began
to fear that he was not going to receive such
a windfall as he had expected from Pansy’s secret.
Having a dangerous secret of his own,
which would be sure to come to light if he proceeded
openly against her, he found himself in
a quandary.</p>

<p>“The plucky little wretch! Who would have
believed that she would openly defy me, and
deny her identity? Why, she would have handed
me over to that policeman in another moment if
I hadn’t cut and run,” he exclaimed angrily, feeling
that he would like to shake the little beauty
for her bold defiance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[194]</span></p>

<p>He slept but little that night for thinking about
her, and the next day he came to the conclusion
that, of all those concerned in the drama in which
he was so cleverly enacting the villain’s part, there
was no chance of blackmailing any but Colonel
Falconer.</p>

<p>“He is rich and will pay liberally for the keeping
of the secret I hold against his wife,” he decided,
and then he set his cunning brain to work
to devise a plan by which to approach Colonel
Falconer on the delicate subject of his wife.</p>

<p>Poor little Mrs. Finley, whom he had long ago
reduced to the status of a trembling, obedient
slave, looked at him in wonder as he lounged
about the house, paying no attention to the grocery,
for he had long ago placed Willie in his
store as a clerk, and the youth was very reliable.
She thought fearfully:</p>

<p>“There is something brewing in his cunning
mind. Has he found out that I have been seeing
my poor little grandchild by stealth, and is he
planning some punishment for me?”</p>

<p>She trembled at the thought, for she knew that
he was both cunning and vindictive. He ruled
her and her children with a rod of iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>He had never forgotten or forgiven the assertion
of his wife, that she would never have married
him if she had known that he would not care
for her children, and he made her and them suffer
for it in various ways. One of his favorite
methods was to taunt them with the disgrace that
Pansy had brought upon them, and another was
to keep alive in Willie’s breast the fierce resentment
and murderous wrath that had taken hold
of him when he first learned that his beautiful
sister had gone astray.</p>

<p>Left to himself and to the remorseful pleadings
of his mother, the young man might have
got over some of his anger, more especially as
poor Pansy had atoned for her fault with her
life. There were times when the remembrance
of her message to him, her pitiful promise that
she would never disgrace him again, stung keenly,
and forced him to accuse himself of being accessory
to her death; but these moods never lasted
long, for whenever Mr. Finley found these kinder
impulses taking root in the youth’s mind he would
dispel them by maliciously hinting that, in all
probability, Pansy was yet alive, and might turn
up at any time to recall to the world the scandal<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
that had trailed its slime over the name of Laurens.</p>

<p>“Pretty Kate North would not smile so sweetly
then when she saw you waiting at the church
door on Sundays,” he suggested, with a leer that
brought the hot color to Willie’s cheeks, for this,
his first real love affair, was a very tender point
with him, and he had often wondered to himself
if pretty little Kate North, with her black eyes
and dimpled red cheeks, thought any the less of
him because of the family disgrace.</p>

<p>His love for Kate made him all the more bitter
in his thoughts toward Pansy.</p>

<p>“How dared she disgrace the family so? I
hate her memory, even though believing her dead
and if I knew she were alive I should be tempted
to carry out my threat, and shoot her on sight,”
he replied angrily to the taunt of his stepfather
that day on which Mr. Finley’s mind was so engaged
in plotting the best means by which to extort
money from Colonel Falconer for keeping
the dark secret of his wife’s past.</p>

<p>He did not know that his malice had overreached
itself, and that the fury smoldering in
Willie’s impetuous mind, and fanned into flame<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
by his sneers and gibes, would bear fruit to disappoint
him of all his avaricious hopes.</p>

<p>Willie was almost twenty now, with an overstrained
sense of honor, sharpened in intensity
by his sister’s fault. He was sensitively alive to
the disgrace that rested on the family name, and
had brooded over it until he had grown morbid.
His handsome young face remained dark and
cloudy after Mr. Finley went out, and his
thoughts were so absorbed that he could scarcely
wait upon the customers who came in and out of
the neat store.</p>

<p>“Strange that he is always suggesting the
thought that Pansy may be alive, after all. Perhaps
he knows more than he chooses to tell,” he
muttered. And the thought wore on him so that
he went to the corner of a shelf, where his stepfather
kept a private bottle, and took a drink of
brandy to steady his shaking nerves.</p>

<p>Then, from a case in a hiding place of his own
he took a small pistol and examined it with
gloomy eyes.</p>

<p>“It is all right,” he muttered hoarsely; then,
at the sound of a step entering the store, he replaced<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
it hurriedly, and turned around, to face
Mr. North, the father of the girl he loved.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. North. What can I do
for you?” he inquired politely.</p>

<p>Mr. North was only a clerk, but he was inordinately
proud and ambitious, and his face darkened
with anger as he returned brusquely:</p>

<p>“I want a few words with you, young man.
My wife tells me that you have been paying some
attention to my daughter Kate?”</p>

<p>“Ye-es, Mr. North,” Willie stammered, with
a boyish flush, adding anxiously: “I trust you
have no objection to my love for her?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You are nothing but a boy,” replied
Mr. North curtly, and the handsome young
face before him deepened in color at the taunt;
but he answered, in a manly way:</p>

<p>“I am almost twenty, and my stepfather has
promised to give me a partnership in the store
when I am twenty-one. My prospects are fair.”</p>

<p>“I care nothing for your prospects! It is your
family I object to,” was the brusque, startling
reply. Then, as if ashamed of the taunt, Mr.
North went on, more gently: “I am sorry to
wound your feelings, Willie; I believe you are a<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
good boy, in the main, although it was said at
one time that you were dissipated and wild. Still,
you had an excuse for that&mdash;the same excuse that
I have in forbidding your attentions to my
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Mr. North!”</p>

<p>“I said that I forbade any more attentions to
Kate. When she marries, it must be one with a
stainless family record. Your sister’s fault has
disgraced her family, and may do so even more
terribly, for there are many who doubt that she
was ever drowned, and she may reappear at any
time.”</p>

<p>“Mr. North, are there any grounds for this
belief?” the poor fellow asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>“A face like hers has been seen several times
in Richmond lately. Some of the factory girls
believe that they saw her yesterday as they came
from work. She is always richly dressed, and it
must be that she is leading a life of gilded shame
in this city.”</p>

<p>A hoarse groan came from the stricken young
man’s lips; then, with flashing eyes, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Then she is running a terrible risk, for only<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
let me find her, and I will send a bullet crashing
through her shameless heart!”</p>

<p>“No, no!” the gentleman exclaimed, recoiling
in dismay, but Willie Laurens angrily reiterated
his threat.</p>

<p>“You will see,” he said. “She wrecked my life,
and I will wipe out the family disgrace in her
heart’s blood.”</p>

<p>“You are mad, simply mad! Would you become
your sister’s murderer, and break your poor
mother’s heart?” cried Mr. North, shocked and
pained by his furious mood, and not dreaming of
the fiery fluid that had inflamed the young man’s
blood. He turned away from the reckless boy,
and was going abruptly out of the store when a
horseman drew rein on the pavement before him,
and asked excitedly:</p>

<p>“Does the mother of Miss Alice Laurens live
here?”</p>

<p>“Yes; is there anything wrong?” inquired Mr.
North curiously, and at the same moment the
pale, agitated face of Willie Laurens appeared in
the doorway, and he said:</p>

<p>“I am the brother of Alice Laurens. What is
wrong?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>The man looked at him with pitying eyes, and
answered:</p>

<p>“Heaven knows I hate to tell you, but I have
no choice. An accident has befallen your sister.
She fell through an open hatchway at Arnell &amp;
Grey’s a few minutes ago, and&mdash;break it to her
mother as gently as you can, for they are bringing
her here now. She is very badly hurt. It is not
believed that she can live.”</p>

<p>“Terrible!” cried Mr. North, as he flung out
his arms to support Willie Laurens, who had
reeled and staggered in agony at that heart-rending
announcement.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">CAUGHT IN A TRAP.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pretty sixteen-year-old Alice Laurens looked
wonderfully like her elder sister as she lay, with
pale face and close-shut lids, upon her little bed,
with her mother and only remaining sister, Nora,
weeping over her, while Mr. Finley hovered, like
a bird of prey, in the background, heartlessly
calculating in his own mind how far this accident
might be turned to his advantage in forcing
Pansy Falconer to own her identity, and to pay
his price for keeping her secret from her proud
husband.</p>

<p>Alice Laurens had a broken arm, and had remained
unconscious ever since her fall, so that
the physicians feared she had sustained internal
injuries that would speedily result in death. One
of them had accompanied her home, and sat in
grave silence, watching the scene, while Willie
Laurens, utterly crushed and disheartened, had
flung himself into a chair, and, with his convulsed
face hidden in his hands, seemed utterly
oblivious to everything but his sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>Altogether, it was a sad scene on which the
parting sun’s rays fell, as they slanted in at the
open door and penciled with golden beams the
prematurely silvered head of the unhappy mother
as she knelt by her unconscious child, uttering
piteous moans of grief and despair, for her afflictions
pressed heavily on her heart.</p>

<p>Minutes passed, and there was apparently no
change in Alice. That she still lived was only
evident from a faint pulsation which the clever
physician could barely detect in her wrist, and
every moment he expected that even that faint,
fluttering spark would go out in death.</p>

<p>The lingering sunset began to fade. Some of
the neighbors came in with hushed footsteps and
sympathetic faces. On the dark, frowning face
of Mr. Finley a light of satisfaction began to
dawn.</p>

<p>When twilight began to darken the summer
sky, he slipped from that solemn chamber, where
they were watching for death to come in and
dispossess the mother’s heart of its treasure, and
disappeared from the scene.</p>

<p>He made his way quickly to Franklin Street,
and rang the bell at Colonel Falconer’s door.<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
When a servant appeared he pushed past him
and unceremoniously entered the wide hall.</p>

<p>“Tell Mrs. Falconer that a man is waiting with
an important message from her husband,” he
said boldly.</p>

<p>The servant showed him into a small reception
room, and disappeared, while Finley waited&mdash;rather
nervously, it must be confessed, for he
was by no means certain that Colonel Falconer
was out. What if he should appear, and kick
the lying intruder out of doors?</p>

<p>But fortune favored him, for in a very few
moments the rustle of a woman’s garments was
audible, and then Pansy appeared before him,
simply clad in a pale-gray traveling dress, and
with a tear-stained face and swollen eyes. She
closed the door carefully behind her, then started
back as she beheld her visitor.</p>

<p>“You!” she exclaimed, in horrified tones.</p>

<p>He rose and bowed profoundly.</p>

<p>“I came to bring you the sad news of poor
Alice, but I see from your face that you have already
heard,” he said pointedly.</p>

<p>Pansy made a scornful gesture, and sank into
a seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[205]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she demanded, trying
to keep up an assumption of indifference that
was only too plainly belied by her trembling voice
and swollen eyelids.</p>

<p>“Your sister Alice, Mrs. Falconer, fell, by accident,
through an open hatchway at Arnell &amp;
Grey’s this afternoon, and is now on her deathbed.
She raves for you&mdash;calls for you every moment.
Can you have the heart to refuse to go
to your dying sister?”</p>

<p>She looked steadily at him, and answered defiantly:</p>

<p>“I have heard of that accident at Arnell &amp;
Grey’s, but what is that to me? I do not know
the poor girl.”</p>

<p>“What is the use your trying to fence with me
like this, Pansy? I know you!” cried Finley
harshly, adding: “But I did not know your cursed
pride was so strong, else I had not come for you,
even to please that poor, dying girl, who begged
me so piteously to come.”</p>

<p>“She did not send you. She believes that her
erring sister died,” Pansy answered irresolutely.</p>

<p>“She believed that once, but not lately. There
have been rumors that she is still alive, that she<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
had been seen of late on the streets of this city,
and that she is living a life of gilded shame.
The story has preyed on the poor girl’s mind, and
she sent me to seek you, that she might pray
you with her dying breath to forsake your sinful
life.”</p>

<p>“You have told those base falsehoods to that
poor, credulous child!” Pansy flashed forth indignantly,
but he denied the accusation, and continued:</p>

<p>“I cannot bear to return to her without you.
The disappointment in her dying eyes would
haunt me. I will make you a proposition, Pansy:
Come with me to her dying bed, and I will manage
things so that you shall see her alone. Not even
her mother shall enter the room, and you shall go
away again, and not a living soul be any the
wiser for your presence there.”</p>

<p>She saw that he was very much in earnest, that
he would do as he said, and, twisting her little
hands together in an agony of indecision, she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Do you know that in little more than an hour
I am to leave here for the White Sulphur Springs?
Miss Ives has already gone around to her friends<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
who will accompany us. My husband will come
home presently to drive with me to the depot.”</p>

<p>“And in the meantime your poor, dying sister
is calling for you in vain. Pansy Laurens, you
are utterly heartless!” exclaimed Mr. Finley, with
a fine show of indignation.</p>

<p>She trembled perceptibly, and grew pale as a
snowdrop under the glare of the gaslight.</p>

<p>“May her uneasy spirit haunt you, and drive
repose from your breast!” he cried tragically.</p>

<p>Whirling toward him with a disdainful gesture
of her white hand, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What if I went with you, simply to humor
the fancy of this poor, dying girl&mdash;mind, I own
to no relationship with her&mdash;what would be the
price of your silence?”</p>

<p>Without moving a muscle, he answered coolly:</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“You are certainly rapacious! I could not give
you such a sum to-night.”</p>

<p>“I should not expect it. I would give you a
week to raise it, if you would leave with me some
of your diamonds as a guarantee of good faith,”
he replied, with an air of business that amused
while it disgusted her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>“Unfortunately, my jewels are packed and my
trunks are gone. You will have to depend upon
my simple word of honor, or go back as you
came,” she replied coldly.</p>

<p>He studied her face a moment, then said sullenly:</p>

<p>“I will take your word of honor, then. You
have too much at stake to risk disappointing me.
So that is settled. Of course, if you did not pay
me in a week I should follow you to the White
Sulphur Springs. Will you come with me now?”</p>

<p>“Go out and hail some passing cab, and keep
it waiting at the corner around the next square.
I will join you there in a few minutes, for I have
no time to lose. I must return here in time to
join my husband,” Pansy answered, dismissing
him with a wave of her hand, and then hastening
upstairs to don a concealing bonnet and veil,
and to leave some plausible excuse with Phebe
for Colonel Falconer, who might return at any
moment.</p>

<p>She left the house regretfully, with unsteady
steps and a foreboding heart, fearing that she
was doing wrong, but drawn by a passionate
yearning to the deathbed of her beloved sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[209]</span></p>

<p>“How could I refuse her dying prayer, even
though its granting be attended with so much risk
and cost to myself?” she thought, with generous
pity and self-sacrificing love.</p>

<p>“Remember,” she said to Finley, as they were
whirled swiftly up the steep grade of Broad
Street toward his home on Church Hill, “I must
see Alice Laurens alone. You will go in first,
and see that every one else leaves the room.”</p>

<p>“I will do so,” he promised, and no more was
said between them. At the corner below his residence
the hack was stopped. He got out, and
directed her to wait until he returned for her.</p>

<p>When he reëntered the house he found that a
great change had taken place in the invalid.</p>

<p>She had recovered full consciousness, and appeared
so much better than had been expected by
her physician that he declared it quite likely she
would recover, if no untoward circumstances intervened.
Fortunately for Finley’s purpose, the
physician was watching by her bed alone, having
persuaded the family to go into the dining room
and partake of tea. A clever thought came to
Finley, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Doctor Hewitt, a man has fallen in a fit on<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
the corner two squares below, and they are hunting
a physician everywhere. I will watch beside
Alice if you will go.”</p>

<p>The physician seized his hat, and, promising
to return after a while, darted out, leaving the
grocer in possession.</p>

<p>He stooped over Alice, who was regarding him
with wide-open, loathing eyes, for he was universally
hated by his stepchildren, and, bending
down, whispered hurriedly:</p>

<p>“Your sister Pansy is coming to see you. Mind,
there must be no outcry, and you must never tell
any one she came, for she can stay but a few
minutes, and no one must ever know she has been
here.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes more the two long-parted
sisters were weeping in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>“Do not try to talk, my darling sister,” whispered
Pansy fondly, while Finley adroitly lowered
the gas and turned the key in the door. Tenderly
caressing Alice, Pansy continued: “I was not
drowned, Alice, but I made you all think so that
you might not worry over my fate. I am the
wife of a good man, but he does not know my<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
sad story, and I can never own my relatives, for
then he would find out everything, and he is so
proud he would cast me off. But I could not stay
away, dear, when they told me you were dying,
so I came in secret.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you came, my precious sister;
but there is some mistake about my dying, for
the doctor says I have a fair chance of getting
well,” Alice answered feebly.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” murmured her beautiful sister,
and the silence of deep emotion fell over them
as they clung to each other.</p>

<p>Finley looked on with exultation. These moments
of reunion between the long-parted sisters
were worth a thousand dollars to him now, and
much more in the future; for, having once established
a claim on Pansy, he would never rest
satisfied until he had wrung from her every dollar
she could command for years to come.</p>

<p>“Oh, Alice, I long to see our mother, but I dare
not do so. She must never know that I am living.
You must keep the secret of this meeting, and, oh,
you must love her well, and be very good to her
for my sake, as well as your own,” murmured
Pansy, with tears in her beautiful eyes, as she<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
drew herself reluctantly from Alice’s clasping
arms.</p>

<p>“Must you go so soon?” sighed the suffering
girl.</p>

<p>“I dare not stay longer,” sobbed Pansy. She
bent down and whispered hurriedly: “Alice, I
will send you some money anonymously, and you
must let no one know it came from me. Spend it
for yourself, mamma, and Nora. Good-by, darling!”
And, pressing her lips to her sister’s
cheek in despairing love, she rose upright, and
said anxiously:</p>

<p>“Mr. Finley, I must go now, or they will come
in and find me here.”</p>

<p>She had pushed her thick veil back to the top of
her bonnet, and her beautiful, pale face was
clearly defined, even in the dim light of the room.
Mr. Finley had forgotten that in this room, which
was upon the first floor, there was a window that
opened upon a narrow alley. The shutters were
drawn, but the sash was raised, and Willie Laurens,
anxious to see how Alice was, but fearful of
intruding on the strict quiet prescribed for her,
had tiptoed through the alley and slanted the
shutters that he might gaze into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>He saw with amazement the beautiful form
kneeling by Alice and clasping her in its tender
arms, saw the fond parting kiss, heard the words
addressed to Mr. Finley, and beheld with mad,
murderous rage the beautiful, despairing face of
the sister whose sin had disgraced him and put
the girl he loved so far above his reach.</p>

<p>The seed Mr. Finley had industriously planted
in his pliant mind had grown by now into a tree
that was ready to bear deadly fruit. With a
smothered imprecation, he rushed back into the
store, and presently, when Pansy came stealing
through the darkened hallway on her way to the
street, her brother was waiting for her with the
fires of hell in his young heart.</p>

<p>He lifted the pistol in his hand, fired, and Pansy
fell, bathed in blood, just inside the doorway.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A SUPPOSED SUICIDE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the very moment that Willie Laurens beheld
his doomed sister fall by his hand, a torrent of
remorse and despair overwhelmed the anger that
had hurried him on to the awful deed, and, hurling
the pistol from his grasp, he rushed to her
side, and fell down on his knees, uttering bitter
cries of remorse and self-reproach.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley, coming instantly upon the scene,
dragged him furiously to his feet.</p>

<p>“You devil, you have killed your sister! Now
fly, fly, and save yourself from the law!”</p>

<p>But even while he spoke, the dining-room door
was thrown violently open, and Mrs. Finley, followed
by Nora, rushed upon the scene.</p>

<p>By the light thrown from the open doorway of
the room they had left, Pansy’s recumbent figure,
with the blood flowing from it, was plainly seen
on the floor.</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven, what is this?” cried the distracted
woman, and Willie wrenched himself<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
loose from his stepfather’s hold, and answered
despairingly:</p>

<p>“Mother, it is Pansy. She came back, as this
wretch here was always hinting she would, and
my fiendish temper got the better of me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And you killed her, you devil!” interrupted
Mrs. Finley. She lifted her arm, shrieking
hoarsely: “Go, go&mdash;with a mother’s curse on your
wicked head! You are no longer a child of
mine.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Finley exclaimed sharply:</p>

<p>“Hush your clatter, you parcel of fools! Perhaps
she is not dead, after all. Doctor Hewitt
will be back in a moment. Willie, go to your
room, and stay there until I come to you!”</p>

<p>Trained to habits of the strictest obedience to
his harsh stepfather, Willie mechanically obeyed,
and then Mr. Finley turned to his wife and said
sharply:</p>

<p>“I shall tell Hewitt that this is a case of suicide,
and don’t either of you dare contradict
me!”</p>

<p>At that moment Doctor Hewitt appeared upon
the doorstep, returning from his fool’s errand,
and Mr. Finley hurriedly drew him in, and shut<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
the door, turning the key in the lock. Strangely
enough, no one had been attracted to the scene
by the sound of the pistol shot, and he felt safe
to carry out the deception.</p>

<p>“Doctor, here is a new case for you!” he exclaimed,
and, turning up the gas, the dreadful
scene was revealed in all its horror and pathos.</p>

<p>Doctor Hewitt had been physician to Arnell &amp;
Grey for many years, and, in the beautiful girl
lying unconscious in a pool of blood on the floor,
he instantly recognized the little factory girl who
had come to harm years ago and then disappeared
so mysteriously as to leave abroad the impression
that she had drowned herself.</p>

<p>“Pansy Laurens!” he exclaimed, in a shocked
tone, and Mr. Finley replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, it is poor Pansy. Is it not dreadful to
think that, after staying away all these years, she
should return to commit suicide in her mother’s
house?”</p>

<p>“Suicide?” echoed Doctor Hewitt.</p>

<p>“Yes; we all heard a shot, and, rushing into
the hall, found Pansy lying like this, and this
pistol on the floor, where it had dropped from<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
her hand,” exhibiting the pistol Willie had thrown
down.</p>

<p>Doctor Hewitt was on his knees by Pansy’s
side, examining her wound, and in a few minutes
he looked up, and said, in a tone of relief:</p>

<p>“She has not succeeded in her awful design.
The bullet only went through her shoulder, and
she is not likely to die from that.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” cried Mrs. Finley gladly,
and her wicked husband could not help slightly
echoing her words, for he was beginning to feel
like a murderer, remembering how he kept at
white heat, by his taunts and sneers, the fire of
murderous rage in Willie Laurens’ heart.</p>

<p>“She must be put to bed at once, and her wound
dressed,” said the physician; and they carried her
upstairs to her own room, where she had spent
such unhappy hours four years ago. Then Mr.
Finley said:</p>

<p>“Doctor Hewitt, I would be glad to keep this
whole miserable affair, even Pansy’s presence in
this house, a secret, for the sake of her innocent
young sisters. Will you help me to do it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Doctor Hewitt replied, and then he sent
Mr. Finley down to see after the patient who had<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
been forgotten for the moment in the horror of
this new calamity.</p>

<p>When Pansy’s wound had been dressed she
revived, and found her mother and sister by her
side. They greeted each other with solemn, tender
sadness, and then Pansy recognized the physician,
and asked him quietly if she were going
to die.</p>

<p>“I hope not. Your wound is a painful one, but
not necessarily dangerous. With good nursing,
you will recover,” he replied pleasantly, and then
he went down to see about Alice.</p>

<p>Pansy lay for a long time in silence, then asked
that Willie might come to her. When he came
into the room, it seemed as if years had gone over
his head, he was so changed by his grief and remorse.</p>

<p>If she knew that his hand had fired that fatal
shot, she made no sign of her knowledge. Greeting
him with tender sisterly love, she drew him
down to her, and whispered softly:</p>

<p>“Go to Franklin Street, and tell Colonel Falconer
to come with you to see his wife. Yes, I
am his wife, Willie,” as he started wildly. “Do<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
not tell him I was wounded. It would startle him
too much. Only ask him to come to me.”</p>

<p>She realized that further concealment of her
past, after all that had happened would be useless.
She must confess all, and throw herself on
Colonel Falconer’s mercy.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AN AMAZED HUSBAND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Willie Laurens found Colonel Falconer pacing
up and down the walk in front of his house,
watching impatiently for his wife’s return from
the errand of kindness on which she had vaguely
told the maid she was going.</p>

<p>It was no wonder he was impatient, for it lacked
scarcely ten minutes to train time. The carriage
was waiting for Pansy, and Phebe, the maid, was
already seated within it.</p>

<p>“You are Colonel Falconer, sir?” Willie Laurens
asked politely.</p>

<p>“Yes. Have you any business with me?”</p>

<p>“A message from your wife. She wishes that
I should conduct you to her side.”</p>

<p>“Has anything happened to my wife?” exclaimed
Colonel Falconer excitedly.</p>

<p>“You will soon know if you will accompany
me,” returned Willie evasively.</p>

<p>“Where is she?”</p>

<p>“At my mother’s house on Church Hill.”</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer gave a keen, scrutinizing<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
glance into the young man’s face by the light afforded
from a gas lamp near by.</p>

<p>Then he started violently.</p>

<p>In the boyish beauty of Willie’s face he detected
a strong likeness to his wife.</p>

<p>“Your name?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Willie Laurens.”</p>

<p>“Are you related to my wife?”</p>

<p>“That is for her to say, Colonel Falconer,”
replied the young man modestly.</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand this at all. My wife
should be here to accompany me at once. She
will miss her train,” exclaimed Colonel Falconer
testily.</p>

<p>“I think she expected that, sir,” was the answer
he received from Willie, who began to grow nervous
as he scrutinized the big, good-looking colonel,
wondering what he would say if he knew that
the slight youth before him had attempted his
wife’s life.</p>

<p>“He would strike me down at his feet in a
moment,” he decided nervously, and, in order to
ward off all further questions, he said:</p>

<p>“I think, sir, that if you would come at once<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
with me to Mrs. Falconer she would explain
everything to your satisfaction.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then, I will do so, for I am very
much puzzled over all this. Will you come with
me in my carriage, Mr. Laurens?”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad of a seat with you, sir, as it
will enable us to reach Mrs. Falconer sooner.”</p>

<p>“Come, then!” And they entered the carriage,
where they found Phebe in a fever of curiosity.</p>

<p>“Would it be advisable to take my wife’s
maid?” the colonel then asked; and Willie, remembering
that Pansy would need a nurse, and
that his mother would have her hands full in caring
for Alice, replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>He then gave the address to the driver, and in
a very short time they arrived at their destination.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had better leave the maid in the
carriage,” suggested Willie, and Colonel Falconer
readily acquiesced, thinking that Pansy would be
ready to accompany him home in a few minutes.</p>

<p>During the drive to Mr. Finley’s house he had
come to the conclusion that Pansy’s warm sympathies
had been enlisted by some charitable object
for which she wished to secure his pity and<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
aid. For this laudable purpose she had doubtless
delayed starting on her trip, thinking that
to-morrow would do as well.</p>

<p>“But Juliette and the Wyldes will have already
gone,” he thought. “No matter; Mrs. Wylde can
chaperon Juliette until Pansy goes.”</p>

<p>But his complacent feelings were soon dissipated,
for, as they went upstairs, Willie Laurens
said reluctantly:</p>

<p>“Colonel Falconer, your wife was seized with
a sudden sickness an hour ago, and you must not
be surprised or frightened if you find her still
in bed.”</p>

<p>Then he threw open Pansy’s door.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE REVELATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Falconer was so shocked and startled
by Willie Laurens’ words that he staggered rather
than walked across the threshold of the room
where Pansy was lying, with close-shut eyes,
among the white pillows of the bed, carefully
watched by Nora Laurens, who now, at a sign
from her brother, arose and left the room.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer found himself alone with
Pansy, and, at the closing of the door, she opened
wide those wondrous eyes of violet blue, and
looked mournfully up into his face.</p>

<p>Oh, the pain, the grief, the despair of that
glance! It went straight to the man’s loving
heart, and he fell on his knees with a groan, and
pressed his lips to her white brow in passionate
love.</p>

<p>She lay still and sorrowful, while fond words
of love poured from his lips, and kisses rained on
her fair face. She said to herself that if he repudiated
her and cast her off after he had heard
her sad confession, she would have the memory<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
of these caresses to comfort her when her noble
husband was lost to her forever.</p>

<p>By and by he lifted his head, and said reproachfully:</p>

<p>“You should not have gone out, my darling,
if you were not feeling well. You know you
have not been strong for some time.”</p>

<p>She knew that she must speak now, and so
she answered faintly:</p>

<p>“I have had an accident, Colonel Falconer. I
have been shot in the shoulder.”</p>

<p>He recoiled with a cry of dismay, and she continued,
in a low but distinct voice:</p>

<p>“Stay here by me, and&mdash;I&mdash;will&mdash;tell you all&mdash;about
it. I am not going to die, they say, although
it&mdash;might&mdash;be&mdash;better if I were.”</p>

<p>“Pansy, you must be raving! You do not mean
that,” he exclaimed, in alarm, and with such a
tender look that she exclaimed remorsefully:</p>

<p>“Ah, how good you are to me! But I do not
deserve it, for I have deceived you shamefully,
and when I have confessed my sin you will&mdash;cast
me off&mdash;you will never&mdash;speak&mdash;to&mdash;poor&mdash;Pansy
again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>“Now I am quite sure that you are raving.
You have done nothing, my precious wife, for
which I could visit you with such harsh punishment
as that,” exclaimed her husband fondly, as
he bent over her and smoothed back with loving
hands the curling locks that strayed over her
blue-veined brow.</p>

<p>A heavy sigh drifted over the lips that were
pale with pain, and Pansy murmured sadly:</p>

<p>“I am not raving. Although I am in great
pain from the wound in my shoulder, I know
quite well what I am saying. I have deceived
you, my kind, noble husband, and when you know
all you will hate me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he replied cheerily, and, clasping
her cold little hand warmly and closely in his, he
murmured reassuringly:</p>

<p>“Come, let us have that dreadful confession,
my pet, that your foolish alarms may be speedily
dissipated.”</p>

<p>But no answering smile met his. Pansy was
as pale as death as she began:</p>

<p>“Louisville was not my&mdash;native place&mdash;as I told
you. I&mdash;I&mdash;was born&mdash;in Richmond&mdash;and I am
at this moment&mdash;under my mother’s roof.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>Colonel Falconer started violently, but he still
kept fast hold of her little hand as she continued:</p>

<p>“That is not all. I&mdash;I&mdash;had run away from my
home when I met Mrs. Beach. There&mdash;there&mdash;was
a stain&mdash;upon my name&mdash;although,” passionately,
“I swear to you it was not my fault!
I am&mdash;Heaven pity me!&mdash;that girl whom Juliette
Ives hates so relentlessly because she caused the
breaking of her engagement with Norman
Wylde.”</p>

<p>“Pansy Laurens!” Colonel Falconer uttered, in
a voice of horror; and he dropped her hand and
started back.</p>

<p>She made no reply. Her confession had exhausted
her strength, and she had fainted.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">NOBLE FORGIVENESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Falconer stood gazing like one petrified
at his unconscious wife until suddenly his
own face whitened to a marble pallor, an expression
of keen agony convulsed his features,
and, clasping both hands upon his breast, he sank
backward into a chair, while a low moan of pain
escaped his lips.</p>

<p>He had been seized with a spasm at the heart,
a misfortune that had befallen him at various
times in his life, but of which he had never spoken
to Pansy, being very sensitive on the score
of the heart disease, which was hereditary in the
Falconer family, and of which his sister, Mrs.
Ives, had died.</p>

<p>For a few moments he lay back in the chair,
struggling with all his strength of mind against
his misery; then, putting his hand into his breast
pocket, he brought out a small vial, from whose
contents he swallowed a few drops. The effect
soon became apparent in a cessation of the terrible<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>
pain. Then a low, frightened cry from the bed
made him look toward Pansy, and he found that
she had revived and was staring at him with a
glance of wonder and fear.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it? Have I killed you?” she
gasped faintly.</p>

<p>“It is nothing&mdash;a slight spasm of the heart,
brought on by excitement. I am better now,”
Colonel Falconer replied coldly, and just then the
door opened and Mrs. Finley came nervously into
the room.</p>

<p>“Mamma, this is Colonel Falconer,” Pansy half
whispered, adding anxiously: “I have told you
how good he has been to me, and I have told him
who and what I am, but briefly. Now I want you
to tell him the story of my willful girlhood, and
the full extent of my sin.”</p>

<p>“Will you listen, sir?” asked the pale, gray-haired
little woman timidly.</p>

<p>A dark frown came between his eyebrows, but
he answered impatiently:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>And so, in the little room where Pansy lay, pale
with pain and despair, the story of her girlhood<span class="pagenum">[230]</span>
was told to the husband she had deceived&mdash;told
kindly and gently by her mother’s lips, yet without
abating one jot of the truth.</p>

<p>“If she had taken her mother’s advice, sir, she
would never have come to this pass. I told her
that a rich young man like Mr. Wylde wouldn’t
think of marrying a poor little factory girl, but
she didn’t believe my warning. She wouldn’t
heed me,” sighed poor Mrs. Finley, when she had
told, in her pitiful little way, the story of Pansy’s
willfulness and disobedience.</p>

<p>But she, poor thing, looked pleadingly at her
pale, silent husband.</p>

<p>“But you see how it was, don’t you?” she cried
imploringly. “I loved him so, and I fell under
his fascinations so that I couldn’t help myself;
and I thought mother would be so pleased when
she found out I was his wife she would forgive
all the rest. Ah, Heaven! I paid dearly, dearly
for that disobedience!”</p>

<p>He sat silent, rigid, looking and listening without
a word, and Pansy sobbed bitterly:</p>

<p>“Did I not say you would never forgive me?
But I deserve it. I have not one word to say for
myself, only this: You will keep my miserable<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
secret, for when Norman Wylde charged me with
my identity I denied it bitterly. Oh, he must
never know the truth, and if I recover from my
wound I will go away from here, Colonel Falconer,
and never trouble your peace again.”</p>

<p>He smiled a sad, derisive smile at those words,
as if in mockery of her promise, and then said:</p>

<p>“But I have not yet heard how you came by
that wound.”</p>

<p>“My brother Willie swore that he would kill
me for the disgrace that I had brought on the
honest name of Laurens. When I came back
home to see my sister he tried to carry out his
threat. I do not blame him, nor must you, for
my stepfather had goaded him to madness by
his taunts and slurs. Poor boy! He is sorry
now for his insane deed, and the world must
never know.”</p>

<p>He smothered some angry words under his
dark mustache, for Pansy was beginning to speak
again in her soft, hopeless little voice:</p>

<p>“While I lay here waiting for Willie to bring
you, I made some clever little plans. Juliette
went with the Wyldes, did she not?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[232]</span></p>

<p>“Then you will telegraph her to-morrow that
I have changed my mind, and will go North to
some gay watering place, but that she will remain
under the chaperonage of Mrs. Wylde. My
presence in this house can be kept a dead secret
until I get well enough to go away&mdash;into a convent,
perhaps&mdash;into lasting exile, certainly. Do
not grieve, mamma,” as a whimper of protest
came from the little woman’s grieved heart. “You
will have your other children, you know.” Then,
looking back at her husband, went on plaintively:
“In the meantime, you will have gone away, and
by and by you will write back to your friends
that poor little Pansy is dead and buried. You
will come home to Juliette then, and&mdash;after a
while&mdash;you will forget.”</p>

<p>The plaintive voice broke, and Colonel Falconer
sat still for a few moments, lost in deep thought.
Suddenly he spoke:</p>

<p>“You are very clever,” he said.</p>

<p>“I thought it all out for your sake. I was so
anxious that no disgrace should touch you,” she
answered humbly.</p>

<p>“Poor little one!” he muttered; then rose and
laid his hand solemnly on her head. “Dear, you<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
have been bitterly punished for your girlish
fault,” he said gravely; then, in tones vibrating
with tenderness, he added: “You are my beloved
wife still. I forgive your deception, and I will
never forsake you.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">IMAGINARY DECEIT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Rosalind, what do you think of this?” asked
Juliette, coming up to her friend with an open
letter in her hand.</p>

<p>It was the second day after her arrival at the
White Sulphur Springs, and they were out on
the lawn before the grand hotel. All was brightness
and gayety. Throngs of beautiful women
and handsome men lent variety to the sylvan
scene, and the merry music played by the band
made one’s step light and one’s heart gay.</p>

<p>“What is it, Juliette?” asked Miss Wylde curiously.</p>

<p>“A letter from my uncle, in which he explains
the cause of his wife not joining us here.”</p>

<p>“Is she not coming, then?” asked Mrs. Wylde,
in a tone of regret.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But why not?”</p>

<p>“She was taken suddenly ill that afternoon, but
would not send us word, lest we should wait for
her and be disappointed in going. She is better<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
now, and has taken up an idea that sea air would
be of more benefit to her than the springs,” replied
Juliette, reading from her uncle’s letter.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am sorry she will not join us. I had
fallen in love with her,” exclaimed Mrs. Wylde,
and her daughter echoed:</p>

<p>“I had, too, mamma.”</p>

<p>A frown crossed Juliette’s pearl-fair face, and
she read on slowly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So I will take her away to the sea, and you can remain
with Mrs. Wylde if she will have the kindness to
chaperon you.”</p>
</div>

<p>She looked at Mrs. Wylde, and that lady said
cordially:</p>

<p>“Your uncle ought to know that I will take
great pleasure in doing that.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” cried Juliette; then, crushing the
letter in her hand, she said spitefully: “I believe
Pansy had all that planned before, and did not
mean from the first to accompany us here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Wylde and Rosalind looked startled.</p>

<p>“Why should she deceive us?” cried Rosalind.</p>

<p>“Oh, she had some hidden design in it, of
course. She is naturally deceitful. I never liked
her from the first!” Juliette cried peevishly,<span class="pagenum">[236]</span>
goaded to jealous anger by their declaration that
they were fond of Pansy.</p>

<p>“Well, you ought to know, of course, having
lived in the same house with her,” exclaimed
Rosalind, in astonishment, adding: “But I never
should have supposed that dear little thing could
be deceitful and designing.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, for she always seemed so frank and
open,” said her mother. “Indeed, I had taken a
great fancy to her.”</p>

<p>Every word stung Juliette more deeply, for she
hated Pansy with an intense hatred. She would
have hated her for marrying her uncle if for nothing
else, but added to this was always her suspicion
of Pansy’s identity, and this fanned the
fire of her rage into fury.</p>

<p>She made an excuse for leaving the Wyldes,
that she might give full vent, in the privacy of her
own room, to the spite that possessed her, and
then Rosalind observed:</p>

<p>“Mamma, I do not think Juliette quite does
justice to Mrs. Falconer. She hates her because
she married Colonel Falconer and disappointed
her expectations of getting all her uncle’s
money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>“That is it,” replied Mrs. Wylde. “Mrs. Falconer
is without doubt a charming woman, and
Juliette’s suspicions of her deceitfulness have
their sole origin in nothing but envy and jealousy.”</p>

<p>While Juliette, alone in her own room, was
saying bitterly:</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they have fallen in love with her,
have they? That is because she is the rich Mrs.
Falconer. They have no admiration to spare for
Norman’s sweetheart, the poor little tobacco-factory
girl, who was quite as beautiful, innocent,
and charming as my uncle’s proud wife.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">GENEROUS DEEDS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Colonel Falconer, out of the generosity
of his great heart, forgave his unhappy wife the
deception she had practiced upon him, he made
up his mind that he would take her away from
the fatal city of her birth, never to return.</p>

<p>They would go abroad, and begin a new life, in
which they would be all in all to each other; and
he would try to forget the dark shadow that lay
on his wife’s past, and make her happy as she had
seemed before they came back to Richmond and
the tragedy of her buried sin rose to overwhelm
her again with its ignominy.</p>

<p>He made arrangements for keeping Pansy’s
presence in her mother’s house a secret from the
world. Phebe was told only such facts as were
strictly necessary, and then installed as the faithful
nurse of her mistress.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer himself came in disguise to
visit her; and Doctor Hewitt, who was the only
one outside the house who was in the secret of
Pansy’s continued existence, never dreamed that<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
the invalid was the wife of one of the grandest,
noblest men in the city, and mistress of a palatial
home on Franklin Street. He pitied her very
much, and advised her one day to remain with
her mother and begin a new life.</p>

<p>Pansy wept bitterly, but made no reply, and
he went away feeling very sad over her probable
future, for both she and Alice were so much
better now that there was no occasion for his further
visits. He would see the beautiful erring
girl no more, and he feared that, with the return
of health and strength, she would drift back to
her old sinful life.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Colonel Falconer busied himself
generously in trying to brighten the lives of
Pansy’s relatives.</p>

<p>In the first place, he had to bribe that wretch,
Finley, to silence on the fact that Pansy Laurens
was still living. He accepted gladly enough a
much smaller sum than he had demanded from
Pansy, fearing that if he demurred he might not
get anything.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer, with his keen insight into
human nature, soon saw that Pansy’s mother was
unhappy and ill-treated&mdash;a mere slave to her sullen,<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
brutal husband. He proposed to Pansy to
settle a sum of money on her mother that should
be strictly her own, and the income from which
would enable her to lead a life of ease, independent
of her miserly husband.</p>

<p>“How shall I ever repay all your goodness?”
Pansy cried, when he told her that he had settled
twenty-five thousand dollars on her mother, and
that Alice and Nora were to be sent to Staunton
to boarding school. His kind intentions toward
Willie were all frustrated, for the young man,
ashamed and remorseful over what he had done,
and standing in great awe of his aristocratic
brother-in-law, had abruptly left home the same
night on which he had wounded Pansy, and as
yet no tidings had been received from him.</p>

<p>The time came when Pansy was to leave home
and mother for the second time, and it was, indeed,
a sad parting; yet not as bitter as the first,
for then Pansy was going alone into exile, but
now there was a strong arm and a brave heart between
her and the world.</p>

<p>“Only love me, my poor little darling,” he had
answered, gently and gravely, in reply to her expressions
of gratitude, and she had promised that<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
she would, while, at the same time, she contrasted
his noble soul with that of Norman Wylde.</p>

<p>“One so noble and high-minded, the other so
false and cruel! Oh, Heaven help me to tear his
image from my weak womanly heart, and enshrine
there this good and noble husband!” she
prayed passionately.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">PLANS FOR THE FUTURE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Two months had passed since Colonel Falconer
had taken Pansy away from Richmond. They
were summering quietly at a little mountain retreat
in the Adirondacks, but his mail was sent
to Cape May, and, by an arrangement with the
postmaster there, was forwarded to him.</p>

<p>He had done this to conceal the place of his
residence from Juliette and others, not wishing
that any prying eyes should intrude upon their
seclusion, for Pansy was still weak and delicate,
and her nerves had been sadly shattered by the
trying scenes she had gone through.</p>

<p>They had taken a little cottage in the mountains,
and, with Phebe and a few servants, were
keeping house in a simple, quiet way, waiting for
the roses to come back to Pansy’s cheeks, that
the colonel might leave her long enough to return
to Virginia and settle up his business, preparatory
to taking up his future residence in Europe.</p>

<p>“You will not take Juliette with us? She hates<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>
me, and every word and glance has a sting for
me. She suspects my identity, in spite of all my
denials,” pleaded Pansy.</p>

<p>“She shall not go with us,” he said; then a
thoughtful frown came between his dark eyebrows.
“But what under heaven shall I do with
her?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Let her stay in the house on Franklin Street
with a chaperon,” answered Pansy readily.</p>

<p>“That will do very well, I suppose; but I wish
she would get married. I should feel better satisfied
over her then,” said the colonel, and they both
thought at once of Norman Wylde.</p>

<p>The color rose to her delicate pearl-fair face in
a warm tide of crimson, and Colonel Falconer
grew pale, and smothered an oath between his
lips.</p>

<p>“Pansy, I feel like I ought to kill that fellow
for his villainy to you,” he said abruptly.</p>

<p>“Let him alone. Heaven will punish him for
my wrongs,” she answered, and then, clasping her
beautiful hands imploringly, she wailed: “But,
oh, my poor, deserted little child, my heart aches
when I think of him! If I only had him with me
I could be content.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[244]</span></p>

<p>“Do not grow impatient, darling. I have promised
to try to get the child for you, but it must
be done very quietly, for no one must suspect that
we had anything to do with abducting him. He
must be abducted, you understand that, do you
not, Pansy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, for I know well that no amount of bribery
would induce Mrs. Meade to give him up,
and I dare not assert my legal claim to him,”
sighed poor, unhappy Pansy.</p>

<p>He tried to comfort her, as if she had been a
little child, and at last she sobbed herself to sleep
in his arms, and he held her thus for more than
an hour, gazing on the sweet, sad little face with
eyes full of love and pity.</p>

<p>“Poor little darling, how bitterly and undeservedly
you have suffered,” he thought, adding
bitterly: “Curses on the false-hearted villain that
betrayed her innocent youth! I hope I may never
meet him again, for if I did I fear I should take
vengeance into my own hands.”</p>

<p>The next morning, when the colonel’s valet
brought in the mail, it consisted of nothing but
the New York papers. He had finished breakfast,
and took them out on the porch to read.<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
Pansy followed him, and sat down in her little
rocking-chair to enjoy the beautiful mountain
scenery that lay outspread like a succession of
pictures before her eyes.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer selected his favorite paper,
lighted his morning cigar, and disposed himself
comfortably to read.</p>

<p>And none seeing the quiet, homelike picture,
the handsome man, and the lovely woman, seeming
so calmly happy in their domestic life, would
have dreamed that a heavy storm cloud surcharged
with woe was about to burst in fury upon
their heads.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer opened his fresh paper, and
the first thing that caught his eyes were these
words, in staring headlines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">A VIRGINIA TRAGEDY,</p>

<p>INVOLVING SOME OF THE F. F. V.’S WITH THE WORKING
CLASSES, AND BEING THE CLIMAX TO A ROMANCE OF LOVE
AND SORROW EQUAL TO ANY EVER EVOLVED FROM THE
BRAIN OF A NOVELIST.</p>
</div>

<p>He uttered an exclamation of interest, and
Pansy looked around.</p>

<p>“What is it, dear?” she asked languidly.</p>

<p>“Nothing&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash; Well, you shall have
the paper presently,” he answered, and read on:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Something more than three years ago there was a
ripple of excitement in the fashionable society of Richmond
over the fact that an engagement of marriage between
two prominent people had been dissolved, owing to
a sudden infatuation on the young man’s part for a beautiful,
charming young girl, an employee at Arnell &amp; Grey’s
tobacco factory.</p>

<p>The girl, though of poor parentage, and compelled to
labor for her own support, was said to be wonderfully
lovely, fairly well educated, and of so fair a character<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
that it had never been sullied by a breath of scandal. But
parents on either side proved unkind. The young man
was forbidden to marry the little beauty, and she on her
part had stern orders from a widowed mother never
to hold any communication with her lover.</p>

<p>In a few months afterward, the young man was sent
on a mission to Europe, and it was supposed that all was
at an end with the unfortunate love affair. But nine
months later there was a scandalous story circulated about
the young girl, to which a color of truth was lent by her
suicide by drowning in the James River. At last, some
of her clothing was found in the river, but her body was
never recovered. At the same time a beautiful, newborn
boy baby was left on the steps of the young man’s father,
and adopted by the old housekeeper.</p>

<p>Two years later the hero of that long-past love affair
returned, and seeing the adopted child, conceived the idea
that it was his own. He sought the mother of his dead
love in order to ascertain the truth, but could not find
her, she having married a second time and removed to
another part of the city. Lately, in desperation, he placed
a detective on the woman’s track, with the result that she
was soon found, and a story of sorrow laid bare that
maddened the hero of the story.</p>

<p>He told the mother that her daughter had been his wife
by a secret marriage in Washington, and by this declaration
was laid bare the perfidy of a wicked stepfather and
a slighted love, who for revenge had bribed the man to
lie about the marriage. This man, Finley by name, was
sent to Washington to verify Pansy Laurens’ declaration
that she was the wife of Norman Wylde. He was bribed
by a fair and slighted lady to declare that there had been
no marriage, thus breaking the heart of the poor girl, who<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
had never received a line from her young husband during
his absence.</p>

<p>When Norman Wylde learned of this horrible perfidy
that had made of his beloved young wife a suicide, and of
his legitimate child a foundling, he went wild with rage
against the villain who had made these things possible, and
struck him with all the fierce strength of an outraged
arm. He fell heavily, and striking his head against the
counter in his store was rendered unconscious by concussion
of the brain.</p>

<p>He is lying now in a state of coma, never having returned
to consciousness since his fall. Norman Wylde
is under heavy bonds pending the result of Finley’s injuries,
but it is believed that a chivalrous Virginia jury
will acquit him of blame in the vengeance he took against
the destroyer of his domestic happiness.</p>
</div>

<p>Pansy turned her head at hearing a strange,
choking sound, and saw her husband with his
head fallen backward, and his face convulsed with
pain, as it had been on the night when she made
her confession to him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">VISIONS OF HAPPINESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When Pansy saw the condition of her husband
she uttered a scream of terror that brought
Colonel Falconer’s valet and her maid rushing to
the scene from the back of the cottage, where
they had been flirting with each other in default
of something better to do.</p>

<p>Charles, the valet, immediately ran into the
house for his master’s drops, while Pansy lifted
her husband’s head and pillowed it against her
breast. Phebe could do nothing but wring her
hands and utter excited ohs and ahs.</p>

<p>“You had better leave him to me, ma’am,”
said Charles, with a composure that betrayed his
familiarity with these painful attacks. He took
her place with polite insistence, and then Pansy
remembered that her husband had seemed a little
excited over something in the paper he was
reading.</p>

<p>She took the paper up from the floor, where it
had fallen, and, in a very few moments, had<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
found out the cause of Colonel Falconer’s sudden
seizure.</p>

<p>Forgetful of everything but herself in the wild
rush of joy that overwhelmed her soul, she rushed
upstairs to her room, and, throwing herself into
a chair, read and reread the precious paper, while
her love for Norman Wylde, so long repressed
and denied, thrilled her whole being again with
inexpressible rapture.</p>

<p>“Oh, my love, my love! You were true to me&mdash;you
loved me, you mourned for me, for I was,
indeed, your wife! The dark stain of disgrace
is effaced from me, and the whole world may
know now that Pansy Laurens was an honored
wife, and that her child had a right to its father’s
name. Oh, my little Pet, my precious child,
would that I could fly this moment and take you
by the hand and lead you to your beloved father,
telling him how much I love you both!” she sobbed
passionately, forgetting for the moment the man
downstairs, whose heart was so bound up in her.</p>

<p>It was not natural that she should remember
him at that moment, for the shock of joy had been
so great as to blot out everything else for the
time being. Joy in Norman’s constancy and love,<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
and horror at the sin of Mr. Finley and Juliette
Ives, filled her whole mind.</p>

<p>She forgot Colonel Falconer and his illness,
forgot that she was another man’s wife, forgot
everything but her love for Norman Wylde, the
young husband from whom she had been sundered
by such a cruel fate.</p>

<p>“Oh, my love, my darling, would that you were
here now,” she kept murmuring over and over,
forgetful of the lapse of time, until she was
startled from her blissful reverie by a low tap
upon the door.</p>

<p>“Come in!” she exclaimed, and the door unclosed,
admitting Colonel Falconer, who was
ghastly pale, and staggered unsteadily across the
threshold.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Pansy, in a heart-piercing tone,
for everything rushed over her at once at the
sight of his haggard, pain-drawn face.</p>

<p>“Poor child! You were so happy that you had
forgotten me,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“Forgive me!” she sighed remorsefully, and
then suddenly the pretty dark head fell back
against her chair, and she became unconscious.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer made no effort to revive her.<span class="pagenum">[252]</span>
He stood by her side, gazing with gloomy eyes
at the white, unconscious face, and at length he
muttered:</p>

<p>“Poor little one! I wish that you would die
now, just as you are; then I should never have
the pain of resigning you to one who has a better
right to you than I have, and in whose love you
will utterly forget him who has had no thought
but of you since first he saw your beautiful face.”</p>

<p>But he did not have his wish granted, for presently
Pansy revived of herself, and looked up
dreamily into his face.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;fainted, did I not?” she murmured
slowly. Then, remembering his illness, she asked:
“Are you better?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, but his face was ghastly
as he said it. Making a brave effort for calmness,
he added: “You stayed away so long, Pansy, that
I grew uneasy, and came to seek you.”</p>

<p>“While I selfishly forgot you in my absorption.
Oh, forgive me! forgive me!” she cried remorsefully.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to forgive. Your news was
startling enough to excuse you for everything,”
he replied patiently. Drawing a chair near her,<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
he continued wistfully: “It must have been a
great shock of joy to you, Pansy, to find that
Norman Wylde was your true husband, instead
of the false-hearted wretch we deemed him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she murmured faintly.</p>

<p>“And you will wish to be restored to him at
once, dear?” he continued, masking with a brave
effort the pain he felt in speaking those words.</p>

<p>She started wildly.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;I&mdash;belong&mdash;to&mdash;you!” she faltered.</p>

<p>“No, dear. The ceremony that bound you to
me is void in law, since you had a husband living
when I married you. You are free of any claim
of mine. Shall you go at once to him, or will
you write for him to come for you?”</p>

<p>She read his keen anxiety in his ghastly face,
and it came to her suddenly that her happiness
would prove a deathblow to this good man, who
was so devoted to her that it seemed impossible
for his enfeebled heart to bear the shock of her
loss.</p>

<p>Looking up at him with troubled eyes, she said:</p>

<p>“Leave me here alone till morning, that I may
decide what is best for me to do.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">REACHING A DECISION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Colonel Falconer would never forget as long as
he lived, nor would Pansy, the awful suspense of
that night. He spent it among the mountains,
walking hard all night, in order to overcome his
misery by sheer physical weakness. She spent it
on her knees by her bedside, praying.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that it would be wrong to desert
Colonel Falconer and go back to her dear
love, her faithful husband, even though she really
belonged to him, for it would surely break Colonel
Falconer’s heart.</p>

<p>“And how could I be happy even with my beloved
Norman and our darling child, if I knew
that I had caused the death of one who loved me
so well, and who had died for my sake?” the
generous young wife kept saying over and over
to herself, and resolutely shutting out of her heart
all thoughts of the happiness she could have if
she returned to Norman.</p>

<p>Passionately as she loved Norman, her young
heart had become so inured to sorrow, that she<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
was capable of making a great sacrifice for another’s
sake, and at last she decided that for
Colonel Falconer’s sake she would bear the burden
of a secret sorrow till the day of her death.</p>

<p>“Norman believes me dead long ago, and he
need never be undeceived,” she thought. “Then,
too, he will have our sweet little boy to comfort
him, while I will pray for them both every night,
and feel that I have done right to sacrifice my
one chance of earthly happiness for another’s
sake.”</p>

<p>Her resolve did not falter, although it had cost
her so much to make it, and in the morning, when
she went down to breakfast, she was pale as a
lily, and the blue circles under her downcast eyes
hinted at bitter tears shed in the lonely vigils of
the night.</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer had come in an hour before
from his wild mountain tramp, and appeared at
breakfast freshly dressed, but wretchedly pale and
weary-looking, with a despairing look in his eyes
that it was impossible to hide.</p>

<p>The unhappy pair made a slight pretense at
eating, then went out on the porch together, and
Pansy said quietly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[256]</span></p>

<p>“Let us walk up the mountain road a little way,
that no one may overhear what I wish to say to
you.”</p>

<p>They walked away out of earshot of Charles
and Phebe, who had no idea that anything was
wrong between their master and mistress, and
then Colonel Falconer asked sadly:</p>

<p>“Have you made up your mind, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes; I shall stay with you.”</p>

<p>He stared at her, speechless with wonder, until
the warm color rose to her face; then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“My dear Pansy, how could you do that? I
explained to you, did I not, that our marriage was
not legal?”</p>

<p>Placing her trembling little hand on his arm,
she whispered:</p>

<p>“I understand all that. What I meant was that&mdash;you&mdash;should&mdash;help
me&mdash;to secure a divorce&mdash;from
Norman Wylde&mdash;that I might quietly remarry
you. It could be done, could it not?”</p>

<p>His face shone with happiness and love as he
replied:</p>

<p>“It would be easy enough, I think; but, Pansy,<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
darling, it would not be right for me to permit
this sacrifice on your part.”</p>

<p>“I will not permit you to call it a sacrifice. I
love you, and I prefer to cast my lot with yours,”
she answered truly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A GREAT SACRIFICE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Heaven help me, for I am scarcely brave
enough to refuse this noble sacrifice of yours,
Pansy,” groaned Colonel Falconer. “Oh, my little
love, are you quite sure you will never regret
this&mdash;never wish for Norman Wylde and your
lost happiness?”</p>

<p>Clasping her slender white hands tenderly
around his arm, and lifting her sad white face,
with all a woman’s tenderness shining out of her
soulful eyes, she replied earnestly:</p>

<p>“The happiness you speak of could not be mine,
for if I left you for Norman the thought of you
would always sadden me so that I should suffer
from remorse and anxiety. I love you, though
not with the wild passion I felt for my first love.
But this deep, steady affection, born of admiration
for your manliness and your many virtues, is
so strong that it would divide the allegiance I
should owe to Norman. You would be ever in
my thoughts, for you need me so much, and
would miss me so much, while he has long believed<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
me dead and could bear the shock of losing me
better. Therefore, if you will help me about the
divorce, I will be your wife again as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p>“I will send the most clever lawyer in New
York to you, Pansy, and you can commit your
case to him. Bless you for your noble decision!
I did not dare hope for such a sacrifice on your
part, but I love you so well that I have not courage
to refuse it.”</p>

<p>She bowed her head in silence, and he continued:</p>

<p>“Of course you understand, darling, that I
must leave you to-day and remain away from
you until the divorce is procured. Do you wish
to remain here quietly with Phebe, Charles, and
the other servants, or have you any other plans?”</p>

<p>She was silent a few moments, then she answered:</p>

<p>“I will remain here.”</p>

<p>He left the mountains for New York City that
day, and on the next she was visited by an eminent
lawyer, who took her case in hand, and assured
her that he believed there would be no difficulty
in securing a divorce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[260]</span></p>

<p>When he had gone she fell sobbing on the floor
of her chamber, crying out:</p>

<p>“Oh, my lost love, my lost love!”</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer wrote her in a few days, saying
that he would go to White Sulphur Springs,
to try to make some arrangements for the future
of Juliette Ives.</p>

<p>“I shall never care for her in the same fashion
as I did before I learned her treachery to you and
Norman Wylde,” he wrote. “But she has no
living relative but me, and she is dependent on me
for support, and, for her mother’s sake, I will not
shirk the responsibility.”</p>

<p>He found his pretty niece cool, impudent, defiant.
She utterly denied her complicity in Mr.
Finley’s crime.</p>

<p>“I did not even know the man. Never saw him
in my life!” she affirmed.</p>

<p>He was staggered by her effrontery and
scarcely knew what to say, and she went on
eagerly:</p>

<p>“Dear uncle, please tell me the truth: You have
found out at last that your wife is really Pansy
Laurens, have you not?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[261]</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he answered sharply; and she
opened wide her pale-blue eyes, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Is it possible she can still deny it, after finding
out that she was really Norman’s wife? Ah, I
see it all now! She will stay with you because
you are rich and her legal husband is poor.”</p>

<p>Colonel Falconer’s eyes flashed wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Beware, Juliette, how you try me too far!
Remember that you are helpless and penniless,
except for my bounty!”</p>

<p>“And because I will not cringe and fawn upon
the lowbred creature you have made your wife,
although, unfortunately, the tie is not a legal one,
you threaten to deprive me of the pittance sufficient
for my support! Very well, I can go and
work in Arnell &amp; Grey’s tobacco factory. You
will not consider it a disgrace for your niece to
work there, as the woman you call your wife
was an employee there for many years!” she
burst out spitefully, her virago temper all aflame,
and goading her to such rebellion that she actually
shook her little jeweled fist in his face.</p>

<p>She knew his good heart and generous nature
so well that she believed she could defy him with
impunity. He would not dare cast her helpless<span class="pagenum">[262]</span>
on the world, no matter what she did to him or
the wife he idolized.</p>

<p>But her insults to Pansy had struck a fire of
rage in his nature, and, while his face whitened
with pain and his eyes gleamed with anger, he
turned on her, and said sternly:</p>

<p>“Since you are so willing to earn your own
support, I wash my hands of a most unwelcome
burden! Go into a tobacco factory as soon as you
please, and I hope you may be industrious enough
to retain a position there as long as Pansy Laurens
did!”</p>

<p>With those words, the offended gentleman
stalked out of the presence of Juliette, who comprehended
instantly that she had gone too far
in her spiteful defiance, and that she must either
humiliate herself by apologizing or go to work,
as she had threatened, to earn her own living.</p>

<p>It did not take her a minute to decide which
of these alternatives to choose, and as soon as
the door banged to behind the irate colonel she
jerked it open and flew swiftly down the corridor,
arresting his quick footsteps by clasping both
hands around his arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, uncle, dear uncle, come back and forgive<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
me! I am sorry I wounded your feelings. I did
not mean it; but every one had deserted me, and
I felt so miserable!” she panted eagerly, as she
clung to his arm.</p>

<p>He stopped short and looked suspiciously into
her false face.</p>

<p>“Where is Mrs. Wylde?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Come back, and I will tell you. We might be
overheard here,” she replied, looking uneasily
down the length of the broad hotel corridor, and
very unwillingly he accompanied her back to her
room. Then she said:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Wylde and Rosalind have gone back to
Richmond, and I am here alone with my maid.”</p>

<p>“She promised to chaperon you,” he said,
frowning.</p>

<p>“I know,” whimpered Juliette; “but we quarreled
dreadfully. They&mdash;they actually believed
that man Finley’s falsehood about me, although
I denied it bitterly. The truth is that they are
the ones in fault, for they sent Norman off to
London on a false scent, just to break up his love
affair; but now they have the meanness to say
that they would never have sent him if they had
known he was actually married to the girl,”<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
panted Juliette angrily, adding: “So we had a
bitter quarrel when they refused to believe my
story. And Mrs. Wylde said she hoped you
would take me from under her care soon, as she
was tired of chaperoning a girl who had brought
such trouble on her poor son. I told her I would
never speak to her again, so then she and Rosalind
packed up and went back, as Judge Wylde
had telegraphed for them. She sent me a note,
asking if I cared to go back with them, and I
declined. But they set every one against me. I
am so stared at and snubbed by people since Finley’s
lies against me were published that I cannot
bear to go outside my room,” concluded Juliette,
going into hysterical sobs.</p>

<p>“This is very bad. I do not know what I shall
ever do with you, Juliette,” sighed the colonel, in
dismay.</p>

<p>“I shall go back to you, of course,” she sobbed.</p>

<p>“No; that plan will not answer any longer. I
can never have you again as a member of my
family,” he replied firmly.</p>

<p>She could scarcely resist the impulse to cry out
against him with the sharpest reproaches, but
wisely restrained herself, and presently he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[265]</span></p>

<p>“I will remain with you here for a week, Juliette,
and in that time I will decide regarding
your future.”</p>

<p>That same day he wrote to Pansy and explained
the situation to her, asking for her advice
in the matter.</p>

<p>When Pansy heard of the sad plight of the girl
whose wickedness had wrought her so much woe
she rejoiced at first, thinking that Juliette had
met her just reward for her sin.</p>

<p>Then kinder, more pitiful thoughts intervened,
and at length she wrote to Colonel Falconer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Send Juliette here to me, and I will stand her friend
if she will treat me with proper respect.</p>
</div>

<p>He read those words to Juliette, who curled
her lip, but did not refuse, for the contempt of
all her old associates in her little social world had
so cowed her that she was only too happy to accept
Pansy’s offer.</p>

<p>When they met again, Pansy said determinedly:</p>

<p>“Miss Ives, there shall be no further concealments
between us. I am Pansy Laurens, as you
thought, but I am going to procure an immediate
divorce from Norman Wylde, that I may be remarried<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
to your uncle, Colonel Falconer. Wait!”
as Juliette was about to make an excited remonstrance.
“It will be against your own interest
to betray me, for your uncle’s will is made in my
favor now, and if you go against me I will use
my strong influence to have you sent adrift penniless.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A FALSE WITNESS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Juliette Ives was walking along the mountain
road just a few rods from the cottage, kicking up
the dead leaves from the ground at every step,
and frowning discontentedly.</p>

<p>“It is almost two months since I came to this
place, and it is as dreary as a prison. I hope we
shall certainly get away this week, or I shall die
of ennui,” she was muttering angrily to herself,
when suddenly she came face to face with a man
who was hurrying in the direction of the cottage&mdash;Norman
Wylde.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had seen Juliette since
Finley’s sullen confession had convicted her of
such a treacherous deed, and Norman’s brow
grew dark at sight of the fair blond face, with its
light-blue eyes, and pale golden tresses flying
loosely in the wind under a picturesque little scarlet
cap, for Juliette was always vain and coquettish,
and even here in this secluded retreat, where
she expected to see no one, paid particular attention
to her personal appearance. But her charms<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
were all unheeded by Norman Wylde, who lifted
his hat with grave courtesy, and was about to
pass by when she arrested him with a pleading
cry:</p>

<p>“Norman&mdash;Mr. Wylde!”</p>

<p>He paused, but with an impatient gesture, and,
coming close up to him, she said eagerly:</p>

<p>“I cannot let pass this opportunity of clearing
myself from the foul imputation cast upon me by
that wicked wretch, Finley. Oh, Norman, I swear
to you that I had nothing to do with his sin! I
did not even know the man.”</p>

<p>She never forgot how handsome and how
scornful her lost lover looked as he fixed his splendid,
piercing black eyes on her false face. Regarding
her with supreme contempt, he answered:</p>

<p>“Unfortunately for your denial, Miss Ives, Finley
had written proofs in his possession that
proved your guilt clearly.”</p>

<p>“I deny it in spite of all his proofs,” she cried
desperately, but, smiling scornfully still, he answered:</p>

<p>“As you please, Miss Ives; but permit me to
pass. I am anxious to meet my wife!”</p>

<p>“You have no wife!” she exclaimed, with such<span class="pagenum">[269]</span>
spiteful yet earnest emphasis that he paused
again, and said:</p>

<p>“Deny it as you will; but I have proved to the
world’s satisfaction that Pansy Laurens is my
wife, and a week ago, when Mr. Finley recovered
from the long stupor and loss of memory that followed
upon his fall, he told me my wife still lived,
in the person of Mrs. Falconer. I wondered why
she had not come at once to me on learning that
she was truly my wife. But, guessing that it
was owing to her sensitive, retiring nature, I set
myself to work to learn her whereabouts. I
learned that she had separated from Colonel Falconer,
and was living here in strict retirement.
I hurried here at once.”</p>

<p>“In spite of all that, I repeat my assertion: You
have no wife!” answered Juliette, with savage
emphasis and barbarous delight in the torture she
was inflicting on his heart.</p>

<p>“My Heaven!” he cried, shuddering. “You do
not mean to tell me that Pansy is dead!”</p>

<p>“No; it is worse than that.” She paused a
moment, watching him keenly, the better to enjoy
her triumph, then added: “She has procured a
divorce from you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[270]</span></p>

<p>Then she shrank in spite of herself, for the
rage and despair on that darkly handsome face
frightened her, defiant as she was, and his voice
seemed to breathe menace as he shouted hoarsely:</p>

<p>“It is false! False as your treacherous heart,
Juliette Ives!” And, with the words, he rushed
madly from her toward the cottage, wild to know
the truth from Pansy’s own beautiful lips.</p>

<p>Juliette followed slowly after, with a white face
of wrath and envy, for she well knew that, though
Pansy was lost to Norman forever, he would
never love another.</p>

<p>Phebe went up to her mistress with a message
from Mr. Wylde, and, after a long interval, returned
with a brief, ambiguous note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I refuse to see you. I received my decree of divorce
this morning, and to-morrow I shall be married to Colonel
Falconer. Forgive me, Norman, for I have acted for the
best as far as I could see my duty. Let our child comfort
you. Love him, and make up to him for his mother’s
loss. I go abroad in a few days, never to return. Forget
me if you can, and if not, remember me with pity. Farewell
forever, and may Heaven bless you!</p>

<p class="ir2 pminus1"><span class="smcap">Pansy.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Crushing the perfumed sheet in his hand, he
staggered across the doorway with a face like a
corpse. A white hand fluttered down on his coat<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
sleeve, and tender blue eyes gazed into his agonized
face.</p>

<p>“You see now!” said Juliette triumphantly.
“She was like the majority of women. She cared
more for Colonel Falconer’s money than for her
husband’s love! Oh, Norman,” her voice sank
into a low, pleading cadence, “will you not forget
her now and make up our wretched quarrel? Remember,
we loved each other before you ever saw
her face!”</p>

<p>“I never loved you&mdash;never! And for the misery
your sin has brought me I curse you!” he answered.
“I have lost her, but it was through
your treachery at the beginning that she was
forced into a position where her noble nature
made her sacrifice herself and me to a mistaken
sense of duty. Ah, I understand her generous
soul! Do not prate to me of gold. She cared
nothing for that, but, in her pity for him, she
has broken both her heart and mine.” And,
throwing off her touch as though it were a serpent’s
coil, he rushed away.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">REMARRIED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In a short time the words were spoken that
made Pansy Laurens for a second time a wife,
and, though it was like a deathblow to her happiness,
she bore herself with proud calmness that
the good man by her side should have no cause
to suspect that she had sacrificed herself for his
sake.</p>

<p>In a few days more they went abroad, taking
Juliette with them, as also the valet and the two
maids. Several months were spent in Italy, then
when winter was past they traveled for several
months. When autumn came round again Colonel
Falconer began to think of purchasing a home
and settling down in the land of his adoption.</p>

<p>Juliette was behaving herself quite well; that
is to say, she was treating her uncle’s wife with
a show of respect, though hating her as bitterly
as ever in her secret heart.</p>

<p>At times she complained to her uncle that she
did not wish to remain always abroad, but he had<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
only to remind her of the snubbing she had received
from her friends at home to reduce her to
instant silence and submission.</p>

<p>At such times she would recall the Wyldes with
bitter chagrin, and she made up her mind that
she would marry a title if she could possibly
compass it, and then go to Virginia to spend her
honeymoon, in order to mortify those of her old
friends who had dared to disapprove of her because
of the revenge she had taken on her rival,
the poor working girl, Pansy Laurens.</p>

<p>She was anxious to get away from the guardianship
of her uncle and his wife. To live always
with the rival who had triumphed over her,
and to have those triumphs renewed daily&mdash;for
Pansy had been a decided success wherever she
had appeared in society, and the society journals
always mentioned them as “Colonel Falconer’s
beautiful bride, and his pretty niece, Miss Ives”&mdash;was
too bitter to her pride.</p>

<p>“I am tired of it all! I have eaten humble pie
till I loathe the taste,” Juliette muttered discontentedly;
and when at last old Sir John Crowley,
who was as yellow as a pumpkin, having spent
the best years of his life in India before succeeding<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
to a baronetcy, proposed marriage to her,
she accepted him joyfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, Juliette, that old man! Why, he is past
sixty, and yellow and ugly and cross!” Pansy
cried, in dismay; but Juliette tossed her head, and
answered:</p>

<p>“You married an old man for his money, and
I’m going to marry one for a title and money,
too, that’s all!”</p>

<p>“But I have heard that he isn’t rich&mdash;that the
title is almost a barren honor. He has nothing
but a small estate in Cornwall. You will have
to nurse him half your time, as he is in poor
health.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care, and I wish you would mind your
own business! Uncle has promised me a marriage
portion, anyhow, and that shall be strictly
settled on myself. Sir John is so much in love
with me that he’ll agree to anything,” Juliette retorted.
But events proved differently. Sir John
would not agree to the proposition, and so Juliette,
in a huff, declared the match off, vowing
that the baronet was a wretched old fortune
hunter.</p>

<p>Following hard upon the breaking of this engagement,<span class="pagenum">[275]</span>
which occurred in the second winter
after Pansy’s remarriage to Colonel Falconer,
came a very sad event.</p>

<p>A beautiful villa at Florence had been purchased,
and the small family had settled down
there for the winter. It was a very pleasant
neighborhood, and one evening they were entertaining
a small party of friends, when the colonel
suddenly complained of severe pains, and a
physician was at once summoned to his side. But
medical skill proved vain, for within an hour he
died, as Juliette’s mother had died, of heart failure.</p>

<p>He comprehended that the end was near, for,
between the paroxysms of pain, he whispered to
Pansy:</p>

<p>“You have made this past year very happy, my
darling. I have never had cause to believe that
you cherished a single regret.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A LOVELY WIDOW.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“I suppose you will go home now and marry
Norman Wylde!” cried Juliette spitefully.</p>

<p>It was almost immediately after the funeral,
and the sad young widow turned a shocked face
upon the heartless speaker.</p>

<p>“Juliette, how can you be so cruel? Do you
think I do not grieve for my noble husband?”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Norman Wylde could comfort you very easily
in your grief,” was the unfeeling reply that sent
Pansy from the room in bitter tears.</p>

<p>Juliette was the trial of Pansy’s daily life. She
had tried all in vain to overcome the girl’s jealous
dislike of her, but it seemed a hopeless task, and
she longed for the time to come when she would
marry and leave her in peace.</p>

<p>“I believe she would murder me if she thought
she could do so without being discovered,” she
thought sometimes fearfully.</p>

<p>She did not dream that her patient endurance
of her dreadful incubus and her never-failing<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
goodness had all along been having their effect
on Juliette, although she struggled bitterly against
that saving influence.</p>

<p>Just now she felt more bitter than usual, for,
in addition to the fact that she believed that
Pansy and Norman would be reunited in a few
weeks, she had found out that her uncle’s will
was made solely in his wife’s favor, with the exception
of a legacy to his niece, the amount of
which was to be decided by Pansy.</p>

<p>The next time Juliette saw Pansy she began
to tease her about the will.</p>

<p>“It was a shame for uncle to treat me so shabbily.
He might have known you would put me
off with just a few hundreds!” she cried spitefully.</p>

<p>Pansy sighed at Juliette’s unrelenting hate, and
answered patiently:</p>

<p>“Colonel Falconer understood me better than
you do, Juliette, or he would never have trusted
your future to me. When his affairs are settled
there will not be more than a hundred thousand
dollars left, as he made several investments lately
that resulted disastrously. But of that hundred
thousand I shall give you fifty thousand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p>“You do not mean it!” Juliette cried incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Pansy answered; and for a minute there
was a silence, which the young widow broke in a
tremulous, pleading voice.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she said, “when this money is settled
on you, Juliette, it will please you best to
leave me, and make a home for yourself elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“You want me to go away&mdash;you are tired of
me!” Juliette cried, in a high, resentful key; and
then Pansy lifted her head and looked at her with
those sad pansy-blue eyes, in which tears of grief
were standing thickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Juliette,” she sobbed, “I&mdash;I&mdash;only want
peace, and you make my life so dreary and unhappy
with your unrelenting hate!”</p>

<p>Juliette did not answer. She gave a choking
gasp and rushed from the room.</p>

<p>Pansy saw her no more for several hours; then
she entered her boudoir with a pale face and very
red eyes, and said humbly:</p>

<p>“Pansy, please do not ask me to leave you! I
love you&mdash;yes, love you, in spite of all my wickedness.
Your goodness and sweetness have been<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
growing on me for years, although I tried to steel
myself to their noble influence, and your words
just now opened my eyes and showed me my
heart. I repent all my wickedness toward you,
and beg you to forgive me for my share in your
unhappiness. Henceforth I will love you as
dearly as my uncle loved you, and I will do all
that I can to atone for my heartless behavior in
the past.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Juliette!” Pansy cried gladly. For it
was an exquisite satisfaction to her to feel that
she had conquered Juliette’s hate at last by her
gentleness and patience.</p>

<p>She accepted Juliette’s repentance by a gentle
kiss on her white brow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A MOTHER’S YEARNING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Pansy wrote to her mother of Colonel Falconer’s
death, and in return received some unexpected
news.</p>

<p>Mr. Finley, after he recovered from the long
spell that had followed upon his fall and the injury
to his head, had become more brutal and morose
than ever, and made life with him very hard
to bear. Finally he announced his intention of
selling out all his property and going to California
to invest the proceeds in real estate. He told his
long-suffering wife that he was tired of her, and
did not propose to take her with him. She acquiesced
very thankfully in this decision, and the
brute had gone away several months before, and
no more had been heard of him, much to her joy
and relief, for she had long ago repented her unfortunate
second marriage.</p>

<p>Soon after Finley left, Willie had returned,
and, to her surprise, he had been hard at work
in New York, and brought back his savings. He<span class="pagenum">[281]</span>
was bitterly repentant for his wicked deed, and
would write to his sister and tell her how much
he had suffered from remorse. Mrs. Finley added
that she was going to help her son set up business
for himself, that he might marry little Kate
North, to whom he was now engaged, with the
free consent of her parents.</p>

<p>“Poor brother Willie! I am glad he is going
to be so happy,” thought Pansy, without a shadow
of anger against the hot-headed boy; and then
she read on, and found that Alice and Nora were
still at school in Staunton. They were learning
fast, and sent much love to their sister, and
grieved for the good brother-in-law who had been
so generous to them all.</p>

<p>“But why does she not say something about my
boy, my little Pet, who, perhaps, has some other
name, now that Norman knows he is his son?”
thought Pansy impatiently; but on turning the
next page she read these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Judge Wylde died last week, and they say he left
a pretty penny to his family, though I don’t think Norman
needs it much, he’s getting rich so fast with his law
business. He works so hard, they say, that he has no
time for any one but his child. He has given it the name<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
of Charley for your poor, dead father, which I think
was quite nice of him. I see the little fellow often, as
the Wyldes are quite friendly with me; also that good
Mrs. Meade, who says she was quite certain from the
first that things would turn out as they have. I haven’t
seen Norman since your husband died. I don’t know how
he takes it, but I hope you and he will make it up some
time, as it can’t do Colonel Falconer&mdash;poor, dear saint&mdash;any
good for you to stay always a widow. But forgive
me, dear daughter, for I know your sorrow is too deep for
me to hint at such things yet.</p>
</div>

<p>Pansy sat silent for a long time, brooding over
those words, and her breast heaved with many
hopeless sighs.</p>

<p>“No one need ever think of that,” she thought
mournfully. “Norman will never forgive me for
what I did. He will think always that it was
for Colonel Falconer’s money, not for pity’s
sake.”</p>

<p>And at thought of her little child, her beautiful
Charley, out of whose love she had been
tricked and cheated by her wicked stepfather,
Pansy wept most bitterly and longingly.</p>

<p>“Whether he ever forgives me or not, I must
see my child sometimes,” she thought; but she determined
that she would spend her year of mourning
at the villa. Life was not so unhappy since<span class="pagenum">[283]</span>
Juliette had repented her wickedness and fallen
in love with her uncle’s wife. They had become
fast friends, and Juliette now prayed earnestly
that the time would come when Pansy would
again be Norman’s wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SUPREME JOY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A year went slowly past, and found Pansy and
Juliette still at the villa; but it was not likely that
the latter would be there much longer, for she
had lately made the acquaintance of a handsome
young man, a rich New Yorker, who had wintered
in Italy, and who had been so very much
smitten with the charms of Miss Ives that he had
proposed marriage on very short acquaintance,
and had been accepted, for he was the first man
who had ever touched her heart since she had lost
Norman Wylde.</p>

<p>In truth, Juliette was very much altered for
the better. She had taken gentle Pansy for her
model, and was fast becoming a changed and improved
woman. Not content with owning her
fault to Pansy, she had written to the Wyldes,
mother and son, and confessed her folly and her
repentance, declaring that she now loved Pansy
as fondly as she had once hated her, and that her
dearest wish now was for the happiness of the
two she had injured so much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[285]</span></p>

<p>When Arthur Osborne first declared his love to
Juliette she had a hard struggle with her pride,
but before she gave him her answer she told him
the whole story of her folly and sin and repentance.</p>

<p>“If you had known this you would not have
asked me to be your wife,” she said sadly.</p>

<p>But she was mistaken, for he reiterated his
offer, declaring that he admired her frankness
and believed in her repentance.</p>

<p>“I will help you to forget your bitter past,”
he said; then Juliette gave him a blushing yes.</p>

<p>The betrothal was a month old when, one day,
as Pansy sat alone in the drawing-room of her
beautiful home, some visitors were announced,
and Mrs. Wylde, with her daughter and a beautiful
little boy, entered the room.</p>

<p>Pansy sprang up with a little startled cry, and
was immediately half smothered in kisses and
embraces from all three.</p>

<p>“Forgive me for my share in your past unhappiness.
I had never seen you, and believed you
to be a coarse, ignorant girl, unsuited to my son
in every way,” murmured Mrs. Wylde regretfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[286]</span></p>

<p>“Let us forget the past,” answered the noble
girl she had injured, as she drew her child to
her breast, wondering, yet not daring to ask,
about his father.</p>

<p>Juliette came in presently, and they met her
with the cordiality of old friends. Then she
looked at Pansy.</p>

<p>“Norman is here, too,” she said smilingly, “but
I think he was doubtful of a welcome, and he
stopped in the summerhouse. Will you meet him
halfway, Pansy?”</p>

<p>The blush that rose to her face betrayed her
heart without words, and Mrs. Wylde said tenderly:</p>

<p>“Go, dear; we will excuse you.”</p>

<p>Juliette took her trembling hand and led her
to the door. Then she kissed her fondly.</p>

<p>“Bless you both, dear!” she said earnestly, and
went back to the guests.</p>

<p>But little Charley, now almost five years old,
followed his newfound mother.</p>

<p>Norman was waiting in the flower-wreathed
summerhouse, and at one glance into each other’s
eyes the two read each other’s heart.</p>

<p>“You will not send me away again, my darling!”<span class="pagenum">[287]</span>
he murmured, as he clasped her to his
heart in passionate love.</p>

<p>A few weeks sufficed for their second courtship.
They were married on the same day with
Arthur Osborne and Juliette Ives. Both the
brides looked wonderfully beautiful, and both the
bridegrooms handsome and happy.</p>

<p>In the spring they all went back to America.
Juliette’s home was to be in New York, but not
the least of Pansy’s pleasures was the fact that
she would spend the rest of her life among the
dear friends and old familiar scenes of her beloved
Richmond.</p>

<p class="p1">No. 1165 of the <span class="smcap">New Eagle Series</span>, entitled
“His Unbounded Faith,” by Charlotte M. Stanley,

<p class="center xxlargefont boldfont">Love Stories</p>

<p>There is a great deal of difference between
love stories and sex stories. There is something
about <em>love</em> which commands respect and
reverence.</p>

<p>There is nothing about the sex story which
commands either. Most decent-minded people
are disgusted with the sort of literature
that some publishers are putting out in the
guise of truth.</p>

<p>If you want to know what a really decent,
clean, wholesome love story is, ask your dealer
to sell you a copy of the <cite>Bertha Clay Library</cite>,
or the <cite>Eagle Library</cite>.</p>

<p>In these two series, you will find everything
that is necessary in fiction to hold your
interest, and a great deal that is preferable to
the sort of stuff which is being put out under
camouflage by certain publishers who are not
very careful either about the way they make

Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
